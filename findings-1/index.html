            <p class="quote">Geographical discoveries are a kind of property, less useful, without doubt, than territorial property, and forming only an imaginary wealth: but as they are connected with national self-love, unsubstantial as they are to the possessor, they have been, at all times, envied and disputed.</p>
            <p class="quote">C-P Claret de Fleurieu, 1790</p>
            <p>This web site provides a record of 671 French names or toponyms given to localities on the Australia coast following the voyages of discovery commanded respectively by Antoine Bruny d’Entrecasteaux (1792–1793) and Nicolas Baudin (1801–1803). Its contents examine the choice and significance of these names in the wake of the French Revolution and the era of the reign of Napoléon Bonaparte.</p>
            <p>These place names selected during the first expedition by its commander d’Entrecasteaux and, after the return of the second expedition, by its zoologist François Péron in collaboration with Louis Freycinet, one of Baudin’s officers, reflect French knowledge, references, ideals and concerns of that time and mirror French history and culture. They provide evidence of French voyages to the south seas at a time in history when the British started to colonise parts of Australia. They bear witness to changes that affected European voyages of discoveries with an increased emphasis on data collections that involve the systematic gathering of information, facts, observations, or samples and the production of reliable and detailed charts of the world that reflected national ambitions.</p>
            <p>The explanations given in the book for the naming of places by participants in the two voyages is an invitation to the reader to discover and understand the complex reasons which led to the choice of these place names, related as they are, to sensitive and national issues that affected France in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Such knowledge is important as the names bestowed by the French form part of the early history of Australia. Today, on Australian maps, about half of these place names allocated by the two French</p>
            <p>expeditions have been discarded while the remaining half often appear in a different orthographic form in conformity with the standard of the Australian English common language. This Anglicisation and the discarding of a many of the French place names based on the right of first discovery (see section 3) masks the historical circumstances that determined their selection.</p>
            <p>For this reason, it will be helpful to the reader to be first introduced to the historical context that, at least implicitly, influenced the choice and distribution of the French names along the Australian coast.</p>
            <p class="section-subtitle">1. The d’Entrecasteaux and Baudin voyages of discovery in the wake of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic period</p>
            <p class="section-subtitle">D’Entrecasteaux&#x27; s voyage</p>
            <p>In France, in September 1791, the French Revolution, which had begun in July 1789, was still in the process of establishing a new order and was undergoing reforms. A National Constituent Assembly had been established, severely reducing the powers of King Louis XVI. His escape in June 1791, when he was attempting to seek refuge with and get help from friendly powers to restore the monarchy in France, ended with his capture in Varennes and his return to Paris. The king’s action further inflamed the discord between royalists and republicans, the latter of whom accused the king of high treason against his own people. French society was in turmoil and preparing to fight a civil war that would pit aristocrats against revolutionaries and factions of the latter against each other, as well as becoming involved in a war with European monarchies. More troubled times lay ahead.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, in Brest, a crew of 219 was waiting for favourable winds to embark on two vessels on an expedition ordered by decree by the newly installed National Constituent Assembly.</p>
            <p>The expedition’s vessels were initially gabarres (flat-bottomed barges), built to the design of the architect Jean-Joseph Ginoux from Le Havre and used for river transport and coastal shipping. They were renamed la Recherche (The Seeker) and l’Espérance (The Hope), an allusion to the voyage’s principal mission to search for the missing La Pérouse. The ships were extensively refitted and reclassified as three-masted</p>
            <p>frigates. Their hulls were doubled with pine, secured with long wide-headed nails, and caulked. Another deck was constructed between their gun-decks and holds to lodge the crews. The vessel la Recherche, formerly la Truite (The Trout), was built in 1787 and was used mainly for transporting wood for use in construction. It was approximatively 36 metres in length and 9.10 meters wide, with a draught of less than 2.5 meters. The crew was composed of one hundred and thirteen people at the time of the expedition’s departure and was captained by Antoine Raymond Joseph de Bruni d’Entrecasteaux*. L’Espérance was initially named La Durance (a French river). It was about 37 meters long, 8.45 meters wide and had 2.5 metres of draught. The frigate left port with a crew about one hundred persons and was captained by the captain was Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec*.</p>
            <p>The voyage’s missions included the surveying and charting of unknown coasts, the collection of specimens of fauna, flora and minerals and reporting on the people inhabiting the lands of the South Seas. A scientific team composed of astronomers, geographers and botanists was part of the crew. Some among them were struggling to gather all the material required for their work because of wartime shortages. The botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de La Billardière* wrote:</p>
            <p class="quote">As my objective was to work more specifically on the observations of plants, I needed a lot of paper, and I wanted to find large-size paper format. It was not at all easy to find twenty-two reams of paper, because all that was left in stores had just been given to the artillery service…</p>
            <p>The expedition left the port of Brest at around 1 pm on 28 September, with a crew reflecting the political divisions of the country. One of the volunteers, Pierre Roch Jurien de la Gravière*, noted:</p>
            <p class="quote">Among our officers, some might regret the abolition, others might fear the return of the privileges of the nobility. Some have embraced the revolutionary ideas with fervour, others, especially of the nobility, might have rejected them, even after having first embraced them.</p>
            <p class="quote">Yet by the end of September 1791, we were out of the harbor from Brest. At that time, the king, brought back from Varennes, had just accepted the constitution drafted by the National Assembly. It was obvious that neither party had the power or the will to control the outcome. The people would be freed from royalty, or royalty would regain its authority and prestige. Each of us aboard our corvettes [actually, the vessels were frigates] was trying to address this alternative consistently with his passions or interests.</p>
            <p>D’Entrecasteaux was able, with mixed success, to deal with this latent discord by urging his subordinates to focus on work of discovery. However, he had to face another type of tension between the &#x27;savants&#x27; – the scientists – described also by Gravière:</p>
            <p class="quote">I have already mentioned the antagonism which, since the beginning of the expedition, had manifested on our corvettes [frigates] between natural history and hydrography. Everything seemed to conspire in favour of this last science .... It should not be surprising that men who saw their life so often imperilled by the imperfection of the charts of which they saw the shortcomings and errors, every day instinctively assign the first rank to the works that could detail the charting and ensure the safety of navigation. … Reefs, rocks, shoals, impenetrable barriers, inaccessible shores or deep and safe bays… hydrography was assured of finding with them unique values for its charts. It drew on charts, with the same religious care and enthusiasm, the reef that she was proud to point out to the sailor&#x27;s vigilance and the port where it invited him to enter … it was obvious that it would have all the honour and would make all the glory of our expedition…The naturalists often complained, and if they were not always right, they were not, it must be agreed, always wrong to complain.</p>
            <p>The priority given to hydrographic investigations reflected the introduction of new scientific approaches, associated with mathematical precision and exactitude, that enabled the chief geographer of the expedition, Charles-François Beautemps-Beaupré (1766–1854)*, to chart with greater accuracy the extensive channels and inlets sheltered from strong wind between the south-eastern coast of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania) and Bruny Island.</p>
            <p>After reaching the western part of New Caledonia and searching in vain for traces of La Pérouse and his expedition, the voyage sailed back along other unmapped sections of the Australian coast, methodically surveyed the Archipelago of Recherche (southwest coast of Western Australia) and revisited the east coast of Tasmania (fig.1).</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The return of the expedition to France was accompanied by tragedy and many unexpected challenges. Scurvy and dysentery had claimed the lives of many officers and sailors, including those of the commander d’Entrecasteaux, off Hermit Island, part of Papua New Guinea, in July 1793, and of his successor, Alexandre d’Auribeau, in Java, in February 1794. Aboard L’Espérance, Huon de Kermadec, had died earlier, in May 1793, in New Caledonia, following a two-month illness that led to etic fever (‘fièvre étique’).</p>
            <p>In late October 1793, when the ships reached Java, governed at that time by the Dutch, the news that Louis XVI had been executed and that Revolutionary France was at war with several European nations, including Great Britain and Holland, widened the split between the expedition’s republican and royalist camps. Those amongst the crew who sympathised with the republican cause were made prisoners by the Dutch colonisers. In addition, the French commander was unable to pay the Dutch administration for accommodation, food and hospital bills, and for the repair of the two ships, which were in poor condition. Hence, the vessels were transferred to the Dutch East India Company at Batavia, on condition that the Dutch would repatriate crew members who wished to return to France, including the prisoners.</p>
            <p>The most senior remaining navy officer of the expedition, Élisabeth-Paul-Édouard de Rossel*, negotiated to bring back to France on board the Dutch fleet the collections and charts made during the voyage. A royalist, he embarked on a convoy with the members of the crew who were attached to the monarchy, while crew members with republican loyalties returned on other vessels via the Isle de France (Mauritius). While the d’Entrecasteaux expedition was underway, France had conquered Holland and renamed it the Batavian Republic. Accordingly, the Dutch convoy was now viewed as an enemy of Britain and its ship carrying the expedition’s papers and collections was boarded off St Helena by the British ship HMS Sceptre under Captain Essington, who confiscated the French samples, rough charts and records.  The five other Dutch ships of the convoy were captured later and the French officers made prisoners. Rossel settled in London after negotiating with the British for permission to work on the hydrographical documents and the findings of the expedition, collaborating with the first hydrographer to the admiralty, Alexander Dalrymple, to copy the charts that caught the British Admiralty&#x27;s eye.</p>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Baudin&#x27;s voyage</p>
            <p>The French Revolution had all but ended on 9-10 November 1799, when Napoléon Bonaparte in a coup d’état seized power over the government of le Directoire, leading to the drawing up of a new constitution and the establishment of le Consulat, with Bonaparte elected as Premier Consul at its head (see entries for Consulat and Directoire in glossary). With his associates he proclaimed: &#x27;Citizens, the revolution is based on the principles that started it. It is over&#x27;. In the war against the Second Coalition (1798–1802) an alliance of Britain, Austria and Russia, Bonaparte led the French armies to a number of victories, among them his decisive defeat of the Austrian army at the Battle of Marengo* in northern Italy, in 1800, which helped to restore the pride and confidence of French citizens in their government and nation.</p>
            <p>Bonaparte surrounded himself with teams of scientists and other experts to govern and reform the country efficiently. During the period 1800–1802, France emerged from deep political and economic insecurity and instability due to Bonaparte’s ability to pacify the country and heal its political and religious divisions.</p>
            <p>In response to representations from a delegation of eminent members of the Institut National des Sciences et Arts on 25 March 1800, Bonaparte consented to the dispatch of an expedition on a voyage of discovery to New Holland (Australia) and Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania), with its main objective to chart the yet unknown parts of its southern coasts, as well as to study its natural history and to collect specimens of its fauna, flora, minerals and rocks. The expedition was placed under the command of Nicolas Baudin, who in 1796-1798 had led a successful voyage to the West Indies from where he brought back a large collection of plants, birds and insects. The two ships of the expedition were the corvettes, le Géographe and le Naturaliste (fig. 2 and 3). The former was a 20-gun Serpente-class corvette, named Uranie in 1797 and renamed Galatée in 1799. Her builder, who had not been paid, refused to launch her until she was bought for the voyage, at which time she was renamed le Géographe. Le Naturaliste was first built as a gabarre and named La Menaçante. Bought for the voyage, she was renamed le Naturaliste in 1800 and was refurbished and reclassified as a corvette.</p>

            <p>The corvettes left Le Havre on the 19th of October 1800 with much more pomp and fanfare than that accompanying the departure of the d’Entrecasteaux expedition, almost ten years earlier. Hamelin, the captain of le Naturaliste described their departure:</p>
            <p class="quote">At 9am, we went out the Vieux Bassin of Le Havre with a fresh breeze from ESE, with our topsails and topgallants, left the jetty, passed under the tower of Francois 1er, greeted by cries of Vive la République. The préfet for maritime affairs, Bertin, was there, and a bourgeois orchestra played patriotic anthems, especially the Chant du départ.</p>
            <p class="quote">Journal of Hamelin, Le 27 vendémiaire An 9” (19 October 1800).</p>
            <p>The Chant du départ is a war song composed during the Revolution and referred to as &#x27;brother of the Marseillaise&#x27; by the soldiers of An II (Year 2 of the republican calendar). Bonaparte liked it better than the Marseillaise and made it the official anthem of the first Empire. After this solemn departure, the voyage was considered by Baudin as &#x27;the most painful I ever did&#x27;, especially because of &#x27;the fussy line of conduct that each (member of the crew) follows&#x27;. Nevertheless, the cartographical and scientific work was extensive. Baudin wrote to Jussieu in November 1802, during his long stopover at Port Jackson (Sydney) between the two stages of his of reconnaissance:</p>
            <p>The land of Leuwin, those of Concorde, and Witt, the Entrecasteaux Canal, Isle Maria and its surroundings, the eastern coast of the large island of Diemen land, the Straits of Bass Strait and Banks Strait, and all the southwest coast of New Holland from Wilson&#x27;s Promontory to the islands of St Peter and St Francis have been recognised in a way sufficient for navigating safely ... The materials that I send to citizen Buache for the construction of the map of the various parts I have just mentioned will provide a very different configuration from that which it has been supposed to date ...</p>
            <p>The &#x27;materials&#x27; (rough charts and geographical data) that Baudin mentioned were brought back to France on board the Naturaliste, arriving at Le Havre on the 7th of June 1803. That was shortly after the breakdown of the Treaty of Amiens (25 March 1802-18 May 1803) and the resumption of colonial and European hostilities with Great Britain.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, le Géographe had carried out further surveying work in Australia before Baudin decided in July 1803 to head back to France. Le Géographe arrived at the port of Lorient in Brittany on 24 March 1804 without the expedition commander, because Baudin had died from tuberculosis on the Isle de France (now Mauritius) in September 1803.</p>
            <p>Less than two months after le Géographe’s return, in May 1804, Bonaparte, Consul for life by plebiscite since 1802, became Emperor of the French as Napoléon the first (his coronation took place on the 2 December 1804).  Le Consulat and the &#x27;République française&#x27; were abolished together with the revolutionary calendar, and the Gregorian calendar was restored. However, administrative reforms continued to be pursued. It was during this new imperial period that the forms of the monarchy and its etiquettes were progressively re-established. It was also then that the atlases and narratives of the d’Entrecasteaux and the Baudin expeditions, in which the place names were registered, were edited and published.</p>

            <p class="quote">Les découvertes géographiques constituent une sorte de propriété, moins utile sans doute que la propriété territoriale et ne formant qu’une richesse imaginaire ; mais, comme elles touchent à l’amour-propre national, si peu substantielles qu’elles soient pour celui qui les possède, elles ont, de tout temps, suscité l’envie et la contestation.</p>
            <p class="quote">C.-P. Claret de Fleurieu, 1790</p>
            <p>Ce site web recense 671 noms français, ou toponymes, attribués à des localités du littoral australien à la suite des voyages de découverte commandés respectivement par Antoine Bruny d’Entrecasteaux (1792–1793) et Nicolas Baudin (1801–1803). Son contenu examine le choix et la signification de ces noms dans le contexte de la Révolution française et de l’époque du règne de Napoléon Bonaparte.</p>
            <p>Ces noms de lieux, choisis lors de la première expédition par son commandant d’Entrecasteaux et, après le retour de la seconde, par son zoologiste François Péron en collaboration avec Louis Freycinet, l’un des officiers de Baudin, reflètent les savoirs, les références, les idéaux et les préoccupations de la France de l’époque, et sont le miroir de son histoire et de sa culture. Ils témoignent des voyages français dans les mers du Sud à un moment où les Britanniques commencèrent à coloniser certaines parties de l’Australie. Ils attestent aussi les transformations qui affectèrent les voyages européens de découverte, avec une insistance accrue sur la collecte de données impliquant le rassemblement systématique d’informations, de faits, d’observations ou d’échantillons, ainsi que la production de cartes du monde fiables et détaillées reflétant des ambitions nationales.</p>
            <p>Les explications données dans l’ouvrage sur la dénomination des lieux par les participants aux deux voyages invitent le lecteur à découvrir et à comprendre les raisons complexes ayant conduit au choix de ces noms, liés qu’ils sont à des enjeux sensibles et nationaux qui ont touché la France à la fin du XVIIIe et au début du XIXe siècle. Cette connaissance est importante, car les noms attribués par les Français font partie de l’histoire ancienne de l’Australie. Aujourd’hui, sur les cartes australiennes, environ la moitié de ces noms de lieux attribués par les deux expéditions françaises ont disparu, tandis que l’autre moitié apparaît souvent sous une forme orthographique différente, conforme au standard de l’anglais australien courant. Cette anglicisation et l’abandon d’un grand nombre de noms français fondés sur le droit de première découverte (voir section 3) masquent les circonstances historiques qui ont déterminé leur sélection.</p>
            <p>Pour cette raison, il est utile d’introduire d’abord le lecteur au contexte historique qui, au moins implicitement, a influencé le choix et la répartition des noms français le long des côtes australiennes.</p>

            <p class="section-subtitle">Le voyage de d’Entrecasteaux</p>
            <p>En France, en septembre 1791, la Révolution française, commencée en juillet 1789, était encore en train d’instaurer un ordre nouveau et poursuivait ses réformes. Une Assemblée nationale constituante avait été mise en place, réduisant fortement les pouvoirs de Louis XVI. Sa fuite en juin 1791, lorsqu’il tentait de trouver refuge auprès de puissances amies et d’obtenir leur aide pour rétablir la monarchie en France, se termina par son arrestation à Varennes et son retour à Paris. L’acte du roi aviva encore le conflit entre royalistes et républicains, ces derniers l’accusant de haute trahison envers son propre peuple. La société française était en plein tumulte et se préparait à une guerre civile opposant aristocrates et révolutionnaires, ainsi que différentes factions révolutionnaires entre elles, tout en s’engageant dans une guerre contre les monarchies européennes. Des temps plus troublés encore s’annonçaient.</p>
            <p>Pendant ce temps, à Brest, un équipage de 219 hommes attendait des vents favorables pour embarquer sur deux navires dans le cadre d’une expédition ordonnée par décret de la nouvelle Assemblée nationale constituante.</p>
            <p>Les navires de l’expédition étaient à l’origine des gabarres (bâtiments à fond plat), construites sur les plans de l’architecte Jean-Joseph Ginoux du Havre et utilisées pour le transport fluvial et le cabotage. Elles furent rebaptisées la Recherche et l’Espérance, allusion à la mission principale du voyage : retrouver La Pérouse disparu. Les navires furent largement réaménagés et reclassés en frégates à trois mâts.</p>
            <p>Leurs coques furent doublées de pin, fixées par de longs clous à large tête, puis calfatées. Un pont supplémentaire fut construit entre les batteries et les cales pour loger les équipages. Le navire la Recherche, anciennement la Truite, construit en 1787, servait principalement au transport de bois destiné à la construction. Il mesurait environ 36 mètres de long sur 9,10 mètres de large, avec un tirant d’eau inférieur à 2,5 mètres. Son équipage comptait cent treize personnes au départ de l’expédition et était commandé par Antoine Raymond Joseph de Bruni d’Entrecasteaux*. L’Espérance portait d’abord le nom de La Durance (rivière française). Elle mesurait environ 37 mètres de long, 8,45 mètres de large et avait 2,5 mètres de tirant d’eau. La frégate quitta le port avec un équipage d’environ cent hommes et était commandée par Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec*.</p>
            <p>Les missions du voyage comprenaient la reconnaissance et la cartographie de côtes inconnues, la collecte de spécimens de faune, de flore, de roches et de minéraux, ainsi que des observations sur les populations habitant les terres des mers du Sud. Une équipe scientifique composée d’astronomes, de géographes et de botanistes faisait partie de l’équipage. Certains peinaient à réunir le matériel nécessaire à leur travail en raison des pénuries liées à la guerre. Le botaniste Jacques-Julien Houtou de La Billardière* écrivait :</p>
            <p class="quote">Comme mon objet était de m’appliquer plus particulièrement aux observations sur les plantes, j’avais besoin de beaucoup de papier, et je voulais trouver du papier de grand format. Il ne fut pas du tout facile de se procurer vingt-deux rames de papier, parce que tout ce qui restait dans les magasins venait d’être attribué au service de l’artillerie…</p>
            <p>L’expédition quitta le port de Brest vers 13 heures, le 28 septembre, avec un équipage reflétant les divisions politiques du pays. L’un des volontaires, Pierre Roch Jurien de la Gravière*, nota :</p>
            <p class="quote">Parmi nos officiers, les uns pouvaient regretter l’abolition, les autres redouter le retour des privilèges de la noblesse. Certains avaient embrassé avec ferveur les idées révolutionnaires ; d’autres, surtout parmi la noblesse, pouvaient les avoir rejetées, même après les avoir d’abord acceptées.</p>
            <p class="quote">Pourtant, à la fin de septembre 1791, nous avions quitté la rade de Brest. Alors, le roi, ramené de Varennes, venait d’accepter la constitution rédigée par l’Assemblée nationale. Il était manifeste qu’aucun parti n’avait le pouvoir ni la volonté de maîtriser l’issue. Le peuple serait affranchi de la royauté, ou la royauté recouvrerait son autorité et son prestige. Chacun de nous, à bord de nos corvettes [en réalité des frégates], cherchait à se déterminer face à cette alternative selon ses passions ou ses intérêts.</p>
            <p>D’Entrecasteaux parvint, avec un succès inégal, à contenir cette discorde latente en exhortant ses subordonnés à se concentrer sur le travail de découverte. Il dut toutefois affronter un autre type de tension entre les « savants » et les hydrographes, également décrit par Gravière :</p>
            <p class="quote">J’ai déjà parlé de l’antagonisme qui, dès le début de l’expédition, s’était manifesté sur nos corvettes [frégates] entre l’histoire naturelle et l’hydrographie. Tout semblait conspirer en faveur de cette dernière science… Il ne faut pas s’étonner que des hommes qui voyaient si souvent leur vie compromise par l’imperfection des cartes, dont ils constataient chaque jour les lacunes et les erreurs, attribuassent instinctivement le premier rang aux travaux capables de préciser le tracé des côtes et d’assurer la sécurité de la navigation. … Récifs, rochers, hauts-fonds, barrières impénétrables, rivages inaccessibles ou baies profondes et sûres… l’hydrographie y trouvait des éléments d’une valeur unique pour ses cartes. Elle y traçait, avec le même soin religieux et le même enthousiasme, le récif qu’elle se glorifiait de signaler à la vigilance du marin et le port où elle l’invitait à entrer… il était évident qu’elle recueillerait tout l’honneur et ferait toute la gloire de notre expédition… Les naturalistes se plaignaient souvent, et s’ils n’avaient pas toujours raison, il faut bien reconnaître qu’ils n’avaient pas toujours tort de se plaindre.</p>
            <p>La priorité donnée aux recherches hydrographiques reflétait l’introduction de nouvelles approches scientifiques, associées à la précision mathématique, qui permirent au géographe en chef de l’expédition, Charles-François Beautemps-Beaupré (1766–1854)*, de cartographier avec une plus grande exactitude les chenaux et anses étendus, abrités des vents forts, entre la côte sud-est de la Terre de Van Diemen (Tasmanie) et l’île Bruny.</p>
            <p>Après avoir atteint la partie occidentale de la Nouvelle-Calédonie et recherché en vain des traces de La Pérouse et de son expédition, le voyage longea d’autres portions non cartographiées de la côte australienne, releva méthodiquement l’archipel de la Recherche (côte sud-ouest de l’Australie-Occidentale) et revisita la côte orientale de la Tasmanie (fig. 1).</p>

            <p>Le retour de l’expédition en France fut marqué par la tragédie et de nombreux aléas. Le scorbut et la dysenterie avaient coûté la vie à de nombreux officiers et marins, notamment au commandant d’Entrecasteaux, au large de l’île Hermit (Papouasie–Nouvelle-Guinée), en juillet 1793, ainsi qu’à son successeur Alexandre d’Auribeau, à Java, en février 1794. À bord de l’Espérance, Huon de Kermadec était mort plus tôt, en mai 1793, en Nouvelle-Calédonie, à la suite d’une maladie de deux mois qui provoqua une fièvre éthique (« fièvre étique »).</p>
            <p>Fin octobre 1793, lorsque les navires arrivèrent à Java, alors gouvernée par les Hollandais, la nouvelle de l’exécution de Louis XVI et de l’état de guerre entre la France révolutionnaire et plusieurs nations européennes, dont la Grande-Bretagne et la Hollande, accentua la fracture entre les camps républicain et royaliste de l’expédition. Les membres d’équipage favorables à la cause républicaine furent faits prisonniers par les colonisateurs hollandais. De plus, le commandement français ne put régler à l’administration hollandaise les frais d’hébergement, de nourriture, d’hôpital et de réparation des deux navires, alors en mauvais état. Les bâtiments furent donc cédés à la Compagnie hollandaise des Indes orientales à Batavia, à condition que les Hollandais rapatrient les membres de l’équipage souhaitant rentrer en France, y compris les prisonniers.</p>
            <p>Le plus ancien officier de marine restant de l’expédition, Élisabeth-Paul-Édouard de Rossel*, négocia le retour en France, à bord de la flotte hollandaise, des collections et des cartes réalisées pendant le voyage. Royaliste, il embarqua avec les membres d’équipage attachés à la monarchie, tandis que les marins de sensibilité républicaine rentrèrent par d’autres bâtiments via l’Isle de France (Maurice). Pendant que l’expédition d’Entrecasteaux était encore en cours, la France avait conquis la Hollande et l’avait rebaptisée République batave. Le convoi hollandais fut dès lors considéré comme ennemi par les Britanniques, et le navire transportant les papiers et collections de l’expédition fut arraisonné au large de Sainte-Hélène par le HMS <em>Sceptre</em>, commandé par le capitaine Essington, qui confisqua les échantillons français, les cartes provisoires et les archives. Les cinq autres navires hollandais du convoi furent capturés plus tard et les officiers français faits prisonniers. Rossel s’établit à Londres après avoir obtenu des Britanniques l’autorisation de travailler sur les documents hydrographiques et les résultats de l’expédition, collaborant avec le premier hydrographe de l’Amirauté, Alexander Dalrymple, pour copier les cartes qui avaient retenu l’attention de l’Amirauté britannique.</p>
            <p class="section-subtitle">Le voyage de Baudin</p>
            <p>La Révolution française était pratiquement terminée les 9–10 novembre 1799, lorsque Napoléon Bonaparte, par un coup d’État, s’empara du gouvernement du Directoire, ce qui conduisit à la rédaction d’une nouvelle constitution et à l’établissement du Consulat, avec Bonaparte élu Premier Consul à sa tête (voir les entrées « Consulat » et « Directoire » dans le glossaire). Avec ses associés, il proclama : « Citoyens, la révolution est fixée aux principes qui l’ont commencée. Elle est finie. » Dans la guerre contre la Deuxième Coalition (1798–1802), alliance de la Grande-Bretagne, de l’Autriche et de la Russie, Bonaparte mena les armées françaises à plusieurs victoires, dont sa victoire décisive sur l’armée autrichienne à la bataille de Marengo* en Italie du Nord, en 1800, qui contribua à restaurer la fierté et la confiance des Français envers leur gouvernement et leur nation.</p>
            <p>Bonaparte s’entoura d’équipes de savants et d’autres experts pour gouverner et réformer efficacement le pays. Au cours de la période 1800–1802, la France sortit d’une profonde insécurité politique et économique ainsi que d’une forte instabilité grâce à la capacité de Bonaparte à pacifier le pays et à apaiser ses divisions politiques et religieuses.</p>
            <p>À la suite des démarches d’une délégation d’éminents membres de l’Institut national des sciences et arts le 25 mars 1800, Bonaparte consentit à l’envoi d’une expédition de découverte vers la Nouvelle-Hollande (Australie) et la Terre de Van Diemen (Tasmanie), avec pour objectif principal de cartographier les portions encore inconnues de leurs côtes méridionales, ainsi que d’étudier leur histoire naturelle et de collecter des spécimens de faune, de flore, de minéraux et de roches. L’expédition fut placée sous le commandement de Nicolas Baudin qui, en 1796–1798, avait dirigé avec succès un voyage aux Antilles d’où il avait rapporté une importante collection de plantes, d’oiseaux et d’insectes. Les deux navires de l’expédition étaient les corvettes le Géographe et le Naturaliste (fig. 2 et 3). La première était une corvette de classe Serpente armée de 20 canons, nommée Uranie en 1797 puis rebaptisée Galatée en 1799. Son constructeur, qui n’avait pas été payé, refusa de la mettre à l’eau avant qu’elle ne soit achetée pour le voyage, moment où elle prit le nom de Géographe. Le Naturaliste fut d’abord construit comme gabarre sous le nom de La Menaçante. Acheté pour l’expédition, il fut rebaptisé le Naturaliste en 1800, réaménagé et reclassé en corvette.</p>

            <p>Les corvettes quittèrent Le Havre le 19 octobre 1800 avec un apparat et un cérémonial bien plus marqués que ceux qui avaient entouré le départ de l’expédition d’Entrecasteaux près de dix ans plus tôt. Hamelin, capitaine du Naturaliste, décrivit leur départ :</p>
            <p class="quote">À 9 heures, nous sortîmes du Vieux-Bassin du Havre avec une jolie brise d’ESE, sous huniers et perroquets ; nous laissâmes la jetée, passâmes sous la tour François 1er, salués par des cris de Vive la République. Le préfet maritime, Bertin, était là, et un orchestre de bourgeois jouait des airs patriotiques, notamment le Chant du départ.</p>
            <p class="quote">Journal de Hamelin, 27 vendémiaire an IX (19 octobre 1800).</p>
            <p>Le <em>Chant du départ</em> est un chant de guerre composé pendant la Révolution et qualifié de « frère de la Marseillaise » par les soldats de l’an II (an 2 du calendrier républicain). Bonaparte le préférait à la Marseillaise et en fit l’hymne officiel du Premier Empire. Après ce départ solennel, le voyage fut considéré par Baudin comme « le plus pénible que j’aie jamais fait », en particulier à cause de « la conduite pointilleuse que suit chacun (des membres de l’équipage) ». Néanmoins, le travail cartographique et scientifique fut considérable. Baudin écrivit à Jussieu en novembre 1802, lors de sa longue escale à Port Jackson (Sydney) entre les deux étapes de sa reconnaissance :</p>
            <p class="quote">La terre de Leuwin, celles de Concorde et de Witt, le canal d’Entrecasteaux, l’île Maria et ses environs, la côte orientale de la grande île de Diemen, les détroits de Bass et de Banks, et toute la côte sud-ouest de la Nouvelle-Hollande depuis Wilson’s Promontory jusqu’aux îles Saint Peter et Saint Francis ont été reconnues d’une manière suffisante pour y naviguer en sûreté… Les matériaux que j’envoie au citoyen Buache pour la construction de la carte des différentes parties que je viens de nommer donneront une configuration bien différente de celle qu’on a supposée jusqu’à ce jour…</p>
            <p>Les « matériaux » (cartes de travail et données géographiques) mentionnés par Baudin furent rapportés en France à bord du Naturaliste, arrivé au Havre le 7 juin 1803. C’était peu après la rupture du traité d’Amiens (25 mars 1802–18 mai 1803) et la reprise des hostilités coloniales et européennes avec la Grande-Bretagne.</p>
            <p>Entre-temps, le Géographe avait poursuivi les relevés en Australie avant que Baudin ne décide, en juillet 1803, de rentrer en France. Le Géographe arriva au port de Lorient, en Bretagne, le 24 mars 1804, sans le commandant de l’expédition, Baudin étant mort de tuberculose à l’Isle de France (aujourd’hui Maurice) en septembre 1803.</p>
            <p>Moins de deux mois après le retour du Géographe, en mai 1804, Bonaparte, consul à vie par plébiscite depuis 1802, devint Empereur des Français sous le nom de Napoléon Ier (son sacre eut lieu le 2 décembre 1804). Le Consulat et la « République française » furent abolis en même temps que le calendrier révolutionnaire, et le calendrier grégorien fut rétabli. Les réformes administratives continuèrent toutefois. C’est au cours de cette nouvelle période impériale que les formes de la monarchie et son étiquette furent progressivement réintroduites. C’est aussi à ce moment-là que les atlas et récits des expéditions de d’Entrecasteaux et de Baudin, dans lesquels les noms de lieux étaient consignés, furent édités et publiés.</p>
