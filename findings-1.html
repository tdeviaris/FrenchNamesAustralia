            <p class="quote">Geographical discoveries are a kind of property, less useful, without doubt, than territorial property, and forming only an imaginary wealth: but as they are connected with national self-love, unsubstantial as they are to the possessor, they have been, at all times, envied and disputed.</p>
            <p class="quote">C-P Claret de Fleurieu, 1790</p>
            <p>This web site provides a record of 670 French names or toponyms given to localities on the Australia coast following the voyages of discovery commanded respectively by Antoine Bruny d’Entrecasteaux (1792–1793) and Nicolas Baudin (1801–1803). Its contents examine the choice and significance of these names in the wake of the French Revolution and the era of the reign of Napoléon Bonaparte.</p>
            <p>These place names selected during the first expedition by its commander d’Entrecasteaux and, after the return of the second expedition, by its zoologist François Péron in collaboration with Louis Freycinet, one of Baudin’s officers, reflect French knowledge, references, ideals and concerns of that time and mirror French history and culture. They provide evidence of French voyages to the south seas at a time in history when the British started to colonise parts of Australia. They bear witness to changes that affected European voyages of discoveries with an increased emphasis on data collections that involve the systematic gathering of information, facts, observations, or samples and the production of reliable and detailed charts of the world that reflected national ambitions.</p>
            <p>The explanations given in the book for the naming of places by participants in the two voyages is an invitation to the reader to discover and understand the complex reasons which led to the choice of these place names, related as they are, to sensitive and national issues that affected France in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Such knowledge is important as the names bestowed by the French form part of the early history of Australia. Today, on Australian maps, about half of these place names allocated by the two French</p>
            <p>expeditions have been discarded while the remaining half often appear in a different orthographic form in conformity with the standard of the Australian English common language. This Anglicisation and the discarding of a many of the French place names based on the right of first discovery (see section 3) masks the historical circumstances that determined their selection.</p>
            <p>For this reason, it will be helpful to the reader to be first introduced to the historical context that, at least implicitly, influenced the choice and distribution of the French names along the Australian coast.</p>
            <p>1. The d’Entrecasteaux and Baudin voyages of discovery in the wake of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic period</p>
            <p>D’Entrecasteaux&#x27; s voyage</p>
            <p>In France, in September 1791, the French Revolution, which had begun in July 1789, was still in the process of establishing a new order and was undergoing reforms. A National Constituent Assembly had been established, severely reducing the powers of King Louis XVI. His escape in June 1791, when he was attempting to seek refuge with and get help from friendly powers to restore the monarchy in France, ended with his capture in Varennes and his return to Paris. The king’s action further inflamed the discord between royalists and republicans, the latter of whom accused the king of high treason against his own people. French society was in turmoil and preparing to fight a civil war that would pit aristocrats against revolutionaries and factions of the latter against each other, as well as becoming involved in a war with European monarchies. More troubled times lay ahead.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, in Brest, a crew of 219 was waiting for favourable winds to embark on two vessels on an expedition ordered by decree by the newly installed National Constituent Assembly.</p>
            <p>The expedition’s vessels were initially gabarres (flat-bottomed barges), built to the design of the architect Jean-Joseph Ginoux from Le Havre and used for river transport and coastal shipping. They were renamed la Recherche (The Seeker) and l’Espérance (The Hope), an allusion to the voyage’s principal mission to search for the missing La Pérouse. The ships were extensively refitted and reclassified as three-masted</p>
            <p>frigates. Their hulls were doubled with pine, secured with long wide-headed nails, and caulked. Another deck was constructed between their gun-decks and holds to lodge the crews. The vessel la Recherche, formerly la Truite (The Trout), was built in 1787 and was used mainly for transporting wood for use in construction. It was approximatively 36 metres in length and 9.10 meters wide, with a draught of less than 2.5 meters. The crew was composed of one hundred and thirteen people at the time of the expedition’s departure and was captained by Antoine Raymond Joseph de Bruni d’Entrecasteaux*. L’Espérance was initially named La Durance (a French river). It was about 37 meters long, 8.45 meters wide and had 2.5 metres of draught. The frigate left port with a crew about one hundred persons and was captained by the captain was Jean-Michel Huon de Kermadec*.</p>
            <p>The voyage’s missions included the surveying and charting of unknown coasts, the collection of specimens of fauna, flora and minerals and reporting on the people inhabiting the lands of the South Seas. A scientific team composed of astronomers, geographers and botanists was part of the crew. Some among them were struggling to gather all the material required for their work because of wartime shortages. The botanist Jacques-Julien Houtou de La Billardière* wrote:</p>
            <p class="quote">As my objective was to work more specifically on the observations of plants, I needed a lot of paper, and I wanted to find large-size paper format. It was not at all easy to find twenty-two reams of paper, because all that was left in stores had just been given to the artillery service…</p>
            <p>The expedition left the port of Brest at around 1 pm on 28 September, with a crew reflecting the political divisions of the country. One of the volunteers, Pierre Roch Jurien de la Gravière*, noted:</p>
            <p class="quote">Among our officers, some might regret the abolition, others might fear the return of the privileges of the nobility. Some have embraced the revolutionary ideas with fervour, others, especially of the nobility, might have rejected them, even after having first embraced them.</p>
            <p class="quote">Yet by the end of September 1791, we were out of the harbor from Brest. At that time, the king, brought back from Varennes, had just accepted the constitution drafted by the National Assembly. It was obvious that neither party had the power or the will to control the outcome. The people would be freed from royalty, or royalty would regain its authority and prestige. Each of us aboard our corvettes [actually, the vessels were frigates] was trying to address this alternative consistently with his passions or interests.</p>
            <p>D’Entrecasteaux was able, with mixed success, to deal with this latent discord by urging his subordinates to focus on work of discovery. However, he had to face another type of tension between the &#x27;savants&#x27; – the scientists – described also by Gravière:</p>
            <p class="quote">I have already mentioned the antagonism which, since the beginning of the expedition, had manifested on our corvettes [frigates] between natural history and hydrography. Everything seemed to conspire in favour of this last science .... It should not be surprising that men who saw their life so often imperilled by the imperfection of the charts of which they saw the shortcomings and errors, every day instinctively assign the first rank to the works that could detail the charting and ensure the safety of navigation. … Reefs, rocks, shoals, impenetrable barriers, inaccessible shores or deep and safe bays… hydrography was assured of finding with them unique values for its charts. It drew on charts, with the same religious care and enthusiasm, the reef that she was proud to point out to the sailor&#x27;s vigilance and the port where it invited him to enter … it was obvious that it would have all the honour and would make all the glory of our expedition…The naturalists often complained, and if they were not always right, they were not, it must be agreed, always wrong to complain.</p>
            <p>The priority given to hydrographic investigations reflected the introduction of new scientific approaches, associated with mathematical precision and exactitude, that enabled the chief geographer of the expedition, Charles-François Beautemps-Beaupré (1766–1854)*, to chart with greater accuracy the extensive channels and inlets sheltered from strong wind between the south-eastern coast of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania) and Bruny Island.</p>
            <p>After reaching the western part of New Caledonia and searching in vain for traces of La Pérouse and his expedition, the voyage sailed back along other unmapped sections of the Australian coast, methodically surveyed the Archipelago of Recherche (southwest coast of Western Australia) and revisited the east coast of Tasmania (fig.1).</p>

            <p>The return of the expedition to France was accompanied by tragedy and many unexpected challenges. Scurvy and dysentery had claimed the lives of many officers and sailors, including those of the commander d’Entrecasteaux, off Hermit Island, part of Papua New Guinea, in July 1793, and of his successor, Alexandre d’Auribeau, in Java, in February 1794. Aboard L’Espérance, Huon de Kermadec, had died earlier, in May 1793, in New Caledonia, following a two-month illness that led to etic fever (‘fièvre étique’).</p>
            <p>In late October 1793, when the ships reached Java, governed at that time by the Dutch, the news that Louis XVI had been executed and that Revolutionary France was at war with several European nations, including Great Britain and Holland, widened the split between the expedition’s republican and royalist camps. Those amongst the crew who sympathised with the republican cause were made prisoners by the Dutch colonisers. In addition, the French commander was unable to pay the Dutch administration for accommodation, food and hospital bills, and for the repair of the two ships, which were in poor condition. Hence, the vessels were transferred to the Dutch East India Company at Batavia, on condition that the Dutch would repatriate crew members who wished to return to France, including the prisoners.</p>
            <p>The most senior remaining navy officer of the expedition, Élisabeth-Paul-Édouard de Rossel*, negotiated to bring back to France on board the Dutch fleet the collections and charts made during the voyage. A royalist, he embarked on a convoy with the members of the crew who were attached to the monarchy, while crew members with republican loyalties returned on other vessels via the Isle de France (Mauritius). While the d’Entrecasteaux expedition was underway, France had conquered Holland and renamed it the Batavian Republic. Accordingly, the Dutch convoy was now viewed as an enemy of Britain and its ship carrying the expedition’s papers and collections was boarded off St Helena by the British ship HMS Sceptre under Captain Essington, who confiscated the French samples, rough charts and records.  The five other Dutch ships of the convoy were captured later and the French officers made prisoners. Rossel settled in London after negotiating with the British for permission to work on the hydrographical documents and the findings of the expedition, collaborating with the first hydrographer to the admiralty, Alexander Dalrymple, to copy the charts that caught the British Admiralty&#x27;s eye.</p>
            <p>Baudin&#x27;s voyage</p>
            <p>The French Revolution had all but ended on 9-10 November 1799, when Napoléon Bonaparte in a coup d’état seized power over the government of le Directoire, leading to the drawing up of a new constitution and the establishment of le Consulat, with Bonaparte elected as Premier Consul at its head (see entries for Consulat and Directoire in glossary). With his associates he proclaimed: &#x27;Citizens, the revolution is based on the principles that started it. It is over&#x27;. In the war against the Second Coalition (1798–1802) an alliance of Britain, Austria and Russia, Bonaparte led the French armies to a number of victories, among them his decisive defeat of the Austrian army at the Battle of Marengo* in northern Italy, in 1800, which helped to restore the pride and confidence of French citizens in their government and nation.</p>
            <p>Bonaparte surrounded himself with teams of scientists and other experts to govern and reform the country efficiently. During the period 1800–1802, France emerged from deep political and economic insecurity and instability due to Bonaparte’s ability to pacify the country and heal its political and religious divisions.</p>
            <p>In response to representations from a delegation of eminent members of the Institut National des Sciences et Arts on 25 March 1800, Bonaparte consented to the dispatch of an expedition on a voyage of discovery to New Holland (Australia) and Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania), with its main objective to chart the yet unknown parts of its southern coasts, as well as to study its natural history and to collect specimens of its fauna, flora, minerals and rocks. The expedition was placed under the command of Nicolas Baudin, who in 1796-1798 had led a successful voyage to the West Indies from where he brought back a large collection of plants, birds and insects. The two ships of the expedition were the corvettes, le Géographe and le Naturaliste (fig. 2 and 3). The former was a 20-gun Serpente-class corvette, named Uranie in 1797 and renamed Galatée in 1799. Her builder, who had not been paid, refused to launch her until she was bought for the voyage, at which time she was renamed le Géographe. Le Naturaliste was first built as a gabarre and named La Menaçante. Bought for the voyage, she was renamed le Naturaliste in 1800 and was refurbished and reclassified as a corvette.</p>

            <p>The corvettes left Le Havre on the 19th of October 1800 with much more pomp and fanfare than that accompanying the departure of the d’Entrecasteaux expedition, almost ten years earlier. Hamelin, the captain of le Naturaliste described their departure:</p>
            <p>At 9am, we went out the Vieux Bassin of Le Havre with a fresh breeze from ESE, with our topsails and topgallants, left the jetty, passed under the tower of Francois 1er, greeted by cries of Vive la République. The préfet for maritime affairs, Bertin, was there, and a bourgeois orchestra played patriotic anthems, especially the Chant du départ.</p>
            <p>Journal of Hamelin, Le 27 vendémiaire An 9” (19 October 1800).</p>
            <p>The Chant du départ is a war song composed during the Revolution and referred to as &#x27;brother of the Marseillaise&#x27; by the soldiers of An II (Year 2 of the republican calendar). Bonaparte liked it better than the Marseillaise and made it the official anthem of the first Empire. After this solemn departure, the voyage was considered by Baudin as &#x27;the most painful I ever did&#x27;, especially because of &#x27;the fussy line of conduct that each (member of the crew) follows&#x27;. Nevertheless, the cartographical and scientific work was extensive. Baudin wrote to Jussieu in November 1802, during his long stopover at Port Jackson (Sydney) between the two stages of his of reconnaissance:</p>
            <p>The land of Leuwin, those of Concorde, and Witt, the Entrecasteaux Canal, Isle Maria and its surroundings, the eastern coast of the large island of Diemen land, the Straits of Bass Strait and Banks Strait, and all the southwest coast of New Holland from Wilson&#x27;s Promontory to the islands of St Peter and St Francis have been recognised in a way sufficient for navigating safely ... The materials that I send to citizen Buache for the construction of the map of the various parts I have just mentioned will provide a very different configuration from that which it has been supposed to date ...</p>
            <p>The &#x27;materials&#x27; (rough charts and geographical data) that Baudin mentioned were brought back to France on board the Naturaliste, arriving at Le Havre on the 7th of June 1803. That was shortly after the breakdown of the Treaty of Amiens (25 March 1802-18 May 1803) and the resumption of colonial and European hostilities with Great Britain.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, le Géographe had carried out further surveying work in Australia before Baudin decided in July 1803 to head back to France. Le Géographe arrived at the port of Lorient in Brittany on 24 March 1804 without the expedition commander, because Baudin had died from tuberculosis on the Isle de France (now Mauritius) in September 1803.</p>
            <p>Less than two months after le Géographe’s return, in May 1804, Bonaparte, Consul for life by plebiscite since 1802, became Emperor of the French as Napoléon the first (his coronation took place on the 2 December 1804).  Le Consulat and the &#x27;République française&#x27; were abolished together with the revolutionary calendar, and the Gregorian calendar was restored. However, administrative reforms continued to be pursued. It was during this new imperial period that the forms of the monarchy and its etiquettes were progressively re-established. It was also then that the atlases and narratives of the d’Entrecasteaux and the Baudin expeditions, in which the place names were registered, were edited and published.</p>
