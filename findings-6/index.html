            <h2>6. The relevance of the nomenclatures of d’Entrecasteaux’s and Baudin’s voyages <a href="findings.html" title="Back to Findings"><img src="img/up-arrow.svg" alt="Back to Findings" style="width:24px; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:8px; opacity:0.8;"></a></h2>
            <p>The nomenclatures of D’Entrecasteaux’s and of Péron and Freycinet represent two differing intentions in their choices of place names. The former follows on from that of La Perouse&#x27;s voyage, where La Pérouse gave the places discovered by his expedition names relating mainly to the geography of the coast, to his officers and savants, and the course of the voyage. Similarly, D’Entrecasteaux’s names gave credit to the work and achievements of his crew and his two vessels, while, at the same time, in the midst of the revolutionary period, the commander did his best to avoid any controversial names with political connotations and outside the scope of the expedition itself. By contrast, Péron and Freycinet created their nomenclature in honour of the French nation, its main actors, heroes and personalities of past centuries who were elevated to the rank French national icons, and its new imperial dynasty. More generally, their nomenclature reflects the Napoleonic imperial dream, based chiefly on the development of a technocratic and scientific elite, and a national narrative filled with heroes and great men and women, victories and epic battles. Whilst D’Entrecasteaux’s nomenclature had not been challenged by the authorities of the time, that of Péron and Freycinet was soon contested at various levels. For its part, the Ministry of the Interior was frustrated in as much as some influential public servants of the ministry were not included, while &#x27;very obscure men were immortalised&#x27; (probably a reference to the names of relatively anonymous public servants such as Forestier, a human resources officer in the Ministry for the Navy and Colonies, who had been helpful to Péron). Moreover, Freycinet had to justify why the high-ranking naval officer Gantheaume* had only been honored with the name of a cape on the large island whose named was devoted to Decrès* (today’s Kangaroo Island). Freycinet explained his choice of that name in a letter written in June 1812 to Decrès.</p>
            <p>…The name of Gantheaume has moreover been chosen as the name of the most illustrious general officer after that of the Minister who directs all the branches of this part of the public service. I think it is necessary to notify Your Excellence that the name of the Admiral has been applied, moreover, to an island of ten leagues circumference, which is situated on the north coast of New Holland at 120 ° of longitude. However, Monseigneur, if it seems proper to you to omit from the nomenclature of Île Decrès the name of Cape Gantheaume, it will be straightforward to substitute another for it, because Monsieur Péron in the first volume of the history of the voyage did not mention it. I could substitute that of Cape Jean Barth…</p>
            <p>Decrès commented on the issue in a short note in the margin of the letter, with some humour:</p>
            <p>Even so Gantheaume has [like me] an island [named after him], I&#x27;m glad to keep him [to keep also his name] in mine.</p>
            <p>Other obstacles postponed further publication of the volumes and atlas of the voyage: On the one hand, foreign scientists were not pleased, as eminent scientists such as Humboldt were not part of the nomenclature. On the other hand, the publication was delayed following the divorce of Napoléon from Joséphine in 1810 to marry the archduchess Marie Louise, the eldest daughter of the emperor of Austria, who became the new empress of the French (in fact, similarly to Marie Antoinette Archduchess of Austria who married Louis XVI). Consequently, in 1806, when working on the historical narrative of the voyage, Péron selected the names of Joséphine and her children as representatives of the imperial family, but, by 1810, when Freycinet was completing the account and the geographical atlas of the voyage for publication, it was Marie Louise who was the Empress of the French. From then on, and until 1814, Marie Louise was the representative, together with the child she had with Napoléon, of the imperial family. This added complication to the publication of Freycinet’s atlas which now included names that were no longer relevant.</p>
            <p>As Madame de Chastenay forthrightly explains in her memoirs about these various mishaps concerning the voyage&#x27;s place names:</p>
            <p>The ministry refused to complete the publication of the expedition to Terra Australis, but did nothing, stood still and hampered any action. Several reasons contributed to that: the nomenclature of all the islands, capes, points and rocks was borrowed, no more, like before, to the almanac and the navigators, but from the imperial calendar and the Institut; foreign scientists were not happy about that. The name of M. de Humboldt did not receive a place in a work where the names of very obscure men were immortalised and, in a very bad form, the author refused to mention the names of public servants very influential in the Ministry of the Interior, which viewed them as being extremely central.</p>
            <p>But the biggest obstacle, during the reign of Marie-Louise, lay in the name of the living Josephine, and we know how insurmountable obstacles become when they are not altogether considered.</p>
            <p>Péron and Freycinet’s imperial nomenclature became even more inappropriate when Freycinet&#x27;s nautical and geographical narrative that describes places and the atlas that positioned them were finally published, in 1815, after the Napoleonic regime had come to an end and the emperor had been sent into exile at St Helena. Freycinet, fully aware of the political inappropriateness of the place names following the restoration of the monarchy, attempted to justify the publication when he wrote:</p>
            <p>Before publishing the nautical part of the voyage myself and to continue Péron&#x27;s account, I would have liked to change a nomenclature that today the political and moral situation of France and Europe repels.; but the first volume had already been on sale for several years, the second was impatiently awaited by a large number of subscribers and it was probably more important to satisfy the public than to suppress the rest of a book whose nomenclature, in the final analysis, cannot harm the nature or the importance of the facts.</p>
            <p>More controversially, the nomenclature failed to respect, in large sections, the European sacrosanct ‘right of first discovery’ by the British navigator Matthew Flinders, which granted him the naming rights along parts of the southern coast of Australia. The disregard of this practice infuriated the British Admiralty. Consequently, more than half of Péron and Freycinet’s place names were removed from the nomenclature and replaced by British names during the colonisation of Australia. This prompted Charles de Fleurieu’s great nephew, Alphonse de Fleurieu, in the late nineteenth century, to lobby the British Government for the restitution of some names that related to features left unnamed by Flinders or by previous navigators. Of the 32 names Alphonse de Fleurieu sought to claim back in South Australia, eight were restored, among them that of Fleurieu Peninsula.</p>
            <p>Today, about half of the place names (339) from the d’Entrecasteaux and Baudin expeditions are registered in an Australian English translation in the database of the Composite Gazetteer of Australia. They represent mostly the names of French scientists and of the ships’ crews. Other place names that have been retained generally have ‘historical’ connotations. The following chapters provide an insight into the meanings and the significance of the initial 670 names given to places in Australia by the French. The choice of most of these names was determined by the authors’ commitment to laud the national esteem that the Napoleonic empire had restored. That their scheme backfired following the emperor’s demise provides us with an example of the twists and turns of human history.</p>
