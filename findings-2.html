            <h2>2. Earlier French voyages and the ‘discovery’ of parts of Australian coasts <a href="findings.html" title="Back to Findings"><img src="img/up-arrow.svg" alt="Back to Findings" style="width:24px; vertical-align:middle; margin-left:8px; opacity:0.8;"></a></h2>
            <p>The voyages of d’Entrecasteaux and Baudin can be regarded in the broader context of earlier French voyages to the South Seas in search of unknown places and the mysterious land, the mythical Terra Australis Incognita, later referred to as Australasia, and then more frequently by the French name of Terres australes, which was thought to be the last part of the world undiscovered by European.</p>
            <p>From the mid-eighteenth century the French Académie des sciences and the Académie de Marine, as well as the publication of Buffon*’s Natural Histories and, more fundamentally, the once celebrated Histoire des navigations aux Terres Australes by Charles de Brosses*, published in 1756, suggested that governments should take charge of voyages of discovery and recommended the inclusion of a scientific team as part of the crews of expeditions. It was in keeping with these new expectations that official instructions to leaders of expeditions included a framework within which officers were required to operate. It was with such instructions, which designated the areas to be explored and the specimens of interest to natural history to be collected, that first the Bougainville expedition (1766–1769) and later the La Pérouse expedition (1785–1788) set out on their respective voyages. While the former completed a circumnavigation of the world, the latter’s expedition was shipwrecked in the Vanikoro Islands, south of the Santa Cruz archipelago, within the Solomon Islands, in the Pacific Ocean. During their travels both commanders named many places along their routes.</p>
            <p>However, these two major expeditions did not contribute much to the knowledge of Australia’s coastlines. Antoine de Bougainville (1729–1811) sailed along the outer edge of what is now known as the Great Barrier Reef without sighting Australia and La Pérouse did not organise surveying missions along the Australian coast and stopped only briefly at Botany Bay, where he anchored just a few days after the arrival of the First Fleet commanded by Captain Arthur Phillip.</p>
            <p>By contrast, the ships of the two other French expeditions reached Australia in separate voyages in 1772 and sketched some sections of the Australian coast.</p>
            <p>Marion Dufresne’s stopover in the eastern coast of Tasmania</p>
            <p>Marc-Joseph Marion Dufresne (1724–1772), a trader and planter based in Isle de France (Mauritius), served as an officier bleu in the French Royal Navy and as a captain for the French East India Company. At the invitation of the island’s administrator, Pierre Poivre, he set sail on 18 October 1771 with two ships—le Marquis de Castries and le Mascarin. The expedition had two main objectives.</p>
            <p>The first was to return the Polynesian Aotourou to his homeland. Aotourou had been brought to France from Tahiti by Bougainville, who later arranged for his return by sending him to Isle de France, with instructions to Poivre to organize the final leg of the journey eastward to Tahiti. Tragically, Aotourou died of smallpox in Madagascar on 6 November 1771, before the plan could be completed.</p>
            <p>The second objective was to explore the southern reaches of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. While Marion Dufresne continued his exploratory route to the Pacific, his two ships collided, causing considerable damage. The commander decided to land on the eastern coast of Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania, 4 March 1772) to re-mast one of the ships and replenish them with fresh water. He encountered Aboriginal Tasmanians, but the meeting turned ugly due to misunderstandings. As a result, stones were thrown at the crew and the Aborigines were fired on, with at least one of them being killed. Marion Dufresne, with some of his companions, was himself killed a few weeks later by Maoris in New-Zealand. No Australian places were named or claimed by the French during this voyage.</p>
            <p>Saint-Aloüarn’s expedition to Western Australia</p>
            <p>The second French expedition was commanded by Yves Joseph de Kerguelen de Trémarec (1734–1797), entrusted by King Louis XVI to search for the unknown Southern Land. Kerguelen was sailing in La Fortune, and his second in command, Louis-Francois de Saint-Aloüarn*, was captaining the gabarre Le Gros Ventre. The two ships became separated in the Indian Ocean. Kerguelen discovered a fog-shrouded island in the southern Indian Ocean and, believing it to be the unknown land, sailed back to France to report his discovery. The island group now bears his name. Following his instructions, Saint-Aloüarn continued to sail east and made landfall on the western Australian coast close to Cape Leeuwin, on the 17 March 1772. During the seventeenth century the Dutch and the British explorer Dampier (1651–1715) had already visited this coast, then referred to as New-Holland. Following the coast to the north, Saint-Aloüarn anchored at Dirk Hartog Island, where he named pointe des Hauts fonds, the most northern cape of this peninsula. He organized a ceremony to claim possession of the land and another to bury one of his crew members, Massicot, who had likely died of scurvy. As a sign of remembrance, based on the journal of Sergeant Lafortune and mentionned by Godard and Kerros, Massicot’s name was given to the bay where he was buried; However, this place name was never adopted in the French atlases published by later voyages that visited the west coast of Australia. Then, Saint-Aloüarn sailed north as far as Melville Island. Saint-Aloüarn died, as well as his second in command, a few days after their return to Isle de France. No action was taken by the French king to take possession of the land.</p>
            <p>These two earlier French voyages were important not so much for what their crews sighted, or missed, of the Australian coast, as for the interest and cautiousness they generated for the d’Entrecasteaux and Baudin expeditions covered in this book. The two captains made a point of finding the places their countrymen had visited and comparing their own bearings and sketches with those of Marion Dufresne and Aloüarn. At the time, this comparative method was used to update the existing charts and to progressively improve their accuracy.</p>
