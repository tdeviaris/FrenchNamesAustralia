        <p>Since its official creation in January 1635, l’Académie française has had one function: to oversee and refine the French language. Its distinguished ‘Dictionnaire de l&#x27;Académie française’ editions define the codes and spelling rules of the French language.</p><p>On August 8, 1793, the institution was abolished by a decree of the Convention nationale (National Convention), along with all the former royal academies. Then, in 1803, by a decree of 3 Pluviôse, Year XI (January 23, 1803), the First Consul Napoléon Bonaparte decided to restore the old academies, but only as divisions (classes) of the Institut de France*. The second of these, the ‘class of French language and literature’ effectively corresponds to the former Académie Française.</p>

        <p>The American Revolutionary War (April 19, 1775 – September 3, 1783), also known as the Revolutionary War or American War of Independence, resulted in American independence from Great Britain. The fighting began on April 19, 1775, followed by the Lee Resolution on July 2, 1776, and the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. During the conflict, the American Patriots received support from the Kingdom of France, as well as to a lesser extent, the Dutch Republic, and the Spanish Empire. The war took place in North America, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic Ocean. Notable naval officers who fought for the American cause included the Marquis de Lafayette and Admiral D&#x27;Estaing, among others.</p>

        <p>Le Bureau des longitudes (Board of Longitude) was established under the government of the National Convention in 1795 to improve the accuracy of data when tracking a ship&#x27;s longitude through astronomical observations and timekeeping instruments. The purpose of this scientific institution was to make advances in astronomical knowledge and the effectiveness of navigational instruments, ultimately enhancing the safety of French navigation and its competitiveness with the British Navy. The Bureau was responsible for managing the Paris Observatory (Observatoire de Paris), which later became independent, as well as for publishing la Connaissance des temps, a collection of nautical almanacs that were essential references during voyages. The Bureau also played a major role in the introduction of the decimal system. Two of its members, Mechain* and Delambre*, used triangulation to measure the length of the meridian between Dunkirk and Barcelona, from which the meter (defined as one ten-millionth of the distance between the terrestrial pole and the Equator) was derived.</p><p>The names of the Bureau&#x27;s first members, including Lagrange*, Laplace*, Lalande*, Cassini*, Borda*, Bougainville*, Méchain*, and Delambre*, are included in the nomenclature of the Voyage of Discovery to the Southern Lands edited by Péron and Freycinet.</p>

        <p>Le Consulat was a political regime established in France following the coup d&#x27;état of 18-19 Brumaire Year VIII (9-10 November 1799), which replaced le Directoire*. It lasted until the establishment of the First Empire on 18 May 1804.</p><p>Under le Consulat, a new constitution was promulgated on December 13, 1799, known as the Constitution of the Year VIII. It was later modified by the Constitution of the Year X (1802), which made Napoleon Bonaparte, the First Consul, Consul for life. With increased power, he was able to appoint his successor and surrounded himself with a court-like entourage: Even without a crown, he became more of a king than any other sovereign in Europe. Bonaparte presented himself as a national reconciler and aimed to transcend party politics: ‘The government no longer knew parties and saw in France only Frenchmen’. He allowed many emigrated nobles, including Rossel*, and outcasts from different revolutionary periods, to return freely to France.</p><p>Financial recovery was aided by the founding of the Bank of France on February 13, 1800; the introduction of the Germinal franc in March 1803; and the creation of a corps of civil servants, specialists in the distribution and collection of taxes, including Mollien* and Cretet*.</p>

        <p>La Convention was a constituent assembly that, during the French Revolution, established the First Republic and governed France from September 1792 until October 26, 1795. It was during the Convention that the Reign of Terror was implemented, where the republican movements in power were radicalized by a violence that brooked no compromise in their fight against the external and internal threats that they faced.</p>

        <p>L’ École normale, also known as the École normale de l&#x27;an III, provided a series of high-level courses for the training of high school teachers. It was established by the Convention in 1795 with the goal of promoting a planned centralized national education system in France. The decree that established the school, issued on 30 October 1794 (9 brumaire an III), stated in its first article that ‘There will be established in Paris an École normale, where citizens from all parts of the Republic, already educated in useful sciences, shall be called upon to learn, from the best professors in all disciplines, the art of teaching.’</p><p>These courses only lasted for four months, from 1 Pluviose of the year III (20 January 1795) to 30 Floréal of the year III (19 May 1795). Nevertheless, the École normale de l&#x27;an III is considered the predecessor of today&#x27;s prestigious École normale supérieure (rue d&#x27;Ulm - Paris) and other French normal schools.</p><p>The professors who taught at the École normale were renowned scholars, and their names are included in the nomenclature of Péron and Freycinet.

        <p>The Napoleonic campaign in the Ottoman territories of Egypt and Syria (Campagne d’Egypte, 1797-1801) followed Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s victorious campaign in Italy in 1797, leaving England as France&#x27;s sole enemy. As general-in-chief of the French army, Bonaparte proposed, along with Talleyrand, to take the war to Egypt, which could serve as a base of operations against British dominance in India.</p><p>The campaign also included a scientific expedition, with about 160 scientists, historians, draftsmen, botanists, and engineers, who accompanied the army to study and describe the country. Their meticulous work led to the emergence of a new science: Egyptology. Many of their names are included in the nomenclature of Péron and Freycinet.</p>

        <p>In 1795, the National Convention established and organized l’Institut national des sciences et des arts (National Institute of Sciences and Arts, referred to in short as the Institut), now known as l’Institut de France, to serve as an assembly for writers, scholars, and artists. This followed the dissolution of the royal academies during the French Revolution. Initially, the Institute had 144 members divided into three classes: Physical Sciences and Mathematics (60 members), Literature and Fine Arts (48 members), and, for the first time, Moral and Political Sciences (36 members).</p><p>During the Consulate, a decree issued on May 13, 1801, introduced a formal dress code for members of the Institute: a black costume adorned with green olive branches embroidered on its sleeves and collar. This ceremonial attire is still worn on solemn occasions today.</p><p>Subsequently, on January 23, 1803 (3 Pluviôse Year XI), another decree reorganized the National Institute of Sciences and Arts. It was divided into four classes: Physical Sciences and Mathematics, French Language and Literature, Ancient History and Literature, and Fine Arts. As part of this restructuring, the class of Moral and Political Sciences was abolished, reflecting an effort to neutralize the republican ideals held by many of its members. These members were allowed to join one of the other, more politically neutral, classes within the newly restructured Institute.</p><p>With the establishment of the Napoleonic Empire in May 1804, the National Institute of Sciences and Arts was renamed l’Institut impérial des sciences, arts et lettres.</p><p>The class of Moral and Political Sciences was later reinstated in 1832 during the reign of Louis XVIII and is now known as the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques.</p><p>The names of the first members of l’Institut are included in the nomenclature of Péron and Freycinet, such as Lagrange*, Laplace*, Delambre*, Legendre*, Monge*, Prony*, Berthoud*, Lalande*, Méchain*, Cassini*, Coulomb*, Berthollet*, Fourcroy*, Vauquelin*, Guyton-Morveau*, Chaptal*, Dolomieu*, Lamarck*, Jussieu*, Cuvier*, Daubenton (albeit Baie Daubenton, mentionned in Péron, F (2011) &#x27;Voyage de découvertes aux Terres Australes&#x27;, Op cit., tome 1, p.318 , is not included in Freycinet atlas), Lacépède*, Hallé*, Parmentier*, Volney*, Cambacérès*, Talleyrand*, Roederer*, Dacier*, Bougainville*, and Jacques-Louis David*. Bonaparte himself was elected a member of the Institut on December 25, 1797, to the mechanical arts division of the science section, replacing Carnot.</p><p>Since 1805, the headquarters of the Institut has been located at the Collège des Quatre-Nations, quai de Conti, in Paris.</p>

        <p>L&#x27;Isle de France was the former name of the island of Mauritius after it became a French colony in 1715. The French governor, Mahé de La Bourdonnais, established Port Louis as a naval base and a ship-building centre. The island was under the administration of the French East India Company until 1767. From that year until 1810, the island was governed by officials appointed by the French Government, except for a brief period during the French Revolution when the local authorities set up a virtually independent government who refused to enforce the Revolutionary’s bans on the slave trade and on slavery and did not warmly welcome the Baudin expedition in 1800. From that year until 1810, the island was governed by officials appointed by the French government, except for a brief period after the French Revolution when local authorities established a virtually independent government that refused to enforce the Revolution’s bans on the slave trade and slavery and did not warmly welcome the Baudin expedition in 1800. However, Napoleon maintained slavery in the French colonies.</p><p>During the Napoleonic Wars, under the governorship of Decaen*, the Isle de France became a base from which French corsairs organised raids on British commercial ships over a vast area of the Indian Ocean, encompassing the entire Mascarene Archipelago (Isle de France, Île Bonaparte [previously Île Bourbon, now La Réunion], and Île Rodrigues) and the entire Seychelles Archipelago to the north. The British ended French hegemony in this part of the Indian Ocean in 1810. Under the Treaty of Paris in 1814, the Isle de France reverted to its former name, Mauritius.</p>

        <p>The La Pérouse expedition was a voyage of discovery led by Jean-François de La Pérouse, also spelt Lapérouse or Lapeyrouse, at the instigation of the French king Louis XVI.</p><p>On August 1, 1785, the explorer set sail from Brest with two frigates: l&#x27;Astrolabe and la Boussole. On board the ships were over 200 scientists specializing in a wide range of disciplines.</p><p>In February 1786, the two ships rounded Cape Horn, before reaching Easter Island in April. After a stopover in Chile, the expedition continued on to Alaska, then California, before crossing the Pacific Ocean to Macao in China in 1787. The ships continued their voyage to the Philippines, Japan, Korea and Kamchatka (in Russia&#x27;s far east). The expedition then sailed to Botany Bay (today&#x27;s Sydney) in New South Wales (Australia), from where La Pérouse sent mail and journals taken by British vessels to France. After leaving Botany Bay, his vessels were wrecked on the Vanikoro reefs in the South Pacific in early 1788. The fate of the expedition remained a mystery for almost 40 years.</p>

        <p>The Legion of Honor was created on May 19, 1802, by the First Consul, Napoleon Bonaparte, as part of a wider reorganization of the State. It was adopted after lengthy discussions in the Council of State, as well as the Tribunat and Legislative Body. The institution aimed to re-establish a complete system of rewards based on individual merit, rather than privileges or exemptions, while respecting the equality of citizens. Bonaparte pursued three objectives with the creation of the Legion: to reconcile the French people exhausted by more than a decade of instability and conflict, to unite them around the ideals of individual and national honor, and to symbolize a strong and unified state by uniting the courage of the military with the talents of civilians. The Legion of Honor was open to both soldiers and civilians from the time it was introduced. The marshals of the Empire, including Berthier*, Soult*, Ney*, Murat*, and Lannes*, were decorated alongside civilian personalities such as senior civil servants, magistrates like Mollien*, doctors like Corvisart*, industrialists, scientists such as Cuvier*, Monge*, and Montgolfier*, and artists like David*, Gros, and Gérard*, as well as architects, musicians, and writers.</p>

With few resources and several dependents, including her sick husband, her young son and three motherless nieces (including Adèle*), Madame Campan moved to Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1794 and opened a small boarding school for young ladies. She remained at the school for eight years, during which time it became a hub of social activity for the Directory and the Consulate.

        <p>The history of the Musée National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle dates to the 17th century. Originally named the Royal Garden of Medicinal Plants, it was established in May 1635 by Louis XIII in Paris as a training ground for future doctors and apothecaries.</p><p>In the 18th century, the garden was instrumental in acclimatizing exotic species brought back from various voyages. Antoine de Jussieu*, for instance, successfully adapted the Java coffee tree in  its greenhouses , which paved the way for its exportation and cultivation in the former French colonies in America.</p><p>Buffon* conducted much of his research at the Royal Garden. It was there that he wrote his landmark work, Natural History, which comprised 36 volumes published between 1749 and 1788. To aid him in his work, Buffon gathered a team of renowned scientists, including Lamarck*, Dolomieu*, Thouin*, Desfontaine*, and others whose names appear in the nomenclature of Péron and Freycinet .</p><p>During the French Revolution, the parisian institution gained autonomy and by decree was officially established as the Musée National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle in 1793. The new institution was led by a director and focused on research and public education. Teaching was divided into twelve professorships, each headed by esteemed professors like Cuvier (comparative anatomy), Fourcroy (chemistry), Jussieu, Desfontaines, and others listed in the nomenclature of Péron and Freycinet.</p><p>The Museum also played a crucial role in the preparation of Baudin&#x27;s voyage, and in 1794, it opened the Menagerie, where a decade later, animals from the expedition were housed.</p>

        <p>Polytechnique is a French engineering school that was established in 1794 under the name ‘École centrale des travaux publics’ to address the shortage of engineers and senior managers in France. The school was renamed École Polytechnique one year later, on September 1, 1795. It recruited students from across France through a competitive examination and had prestigious lecturers and professors such as Monge*, Laplace*, and Prony*, Berthollet*, Vauquelin*, Fourcroy*, and Lagrange*, encompassed in the nomenclature of Péron and Freycinet.</p><p>In 1796, a decree appointed three to five admission examiners, including Laplace, who were responsible for selecting mathematically gifted candidates during tours throughout France. At the time, the École Polytechnique was a civilian institution and the students were non-residential. Graduates of the Polytechnique would attend Ecoles d’application (engineering schools of instruction) to learn practical engineering skills. Among Baudin’s crew, Boullanger* and Faure* studied in the school of the ‘ingénieurs géographes’ specialised in surveying and geographical expertise, Maurouard* and Hyacinthe de Bougainville* in that of the military navy, and Bailly* in the school of ‘arts et manufactures’.</p><p>About fifty students and a dozen teachers and staff of the Polytechnique and these schools accompanied General Bonaparte to Egypt, where their scientific surveys contributed to the publication of the Description d&#x27;Égypte. The Polytechnique was highly valued by Napoleon Bonaparte, who considered it to be ‘his goose that lays the golden eggs’ due to the large number of officers in his army and leaders of his administration who had graduated from it.</p><p>In 1804, Napoleon gave the Polytechnique military status and a motto: ‘Pour la Patrie, les Sciences et la Gloire’.</p><p>Since the end of 2013, Polytechnique has had a new logo that includes the letter  ‘X,’ the school&#x27;s nickname since the mid-19th century. It derives from both the crossed gun barrels of the school’s coat of arms, and the use of the ‘X’ symbol in polynomial algebra.</p><p>Further reading: Belhoste, B.

        <p>On May 18, 1804, the Consulat was transformed into a hereditary empire. The coronation and consecration ceremony took place at Notre-Dame de Paris on December 2, 1804. In exchange for the French bishops&#x27; adherence to the Concordat between the French state and the Catholic Church, and their submission to the Pope, the pope Pius VII agreed to preside over the ceremony. However, contrary to tradition, Napoléon insisted on crowning himself and also placing the crown on Empress Josephine, leaving Pope Pius VII to merely bless the crown.</p><p>The regime was built on the model of a monarchy and established through the senatus-consultum of 28 Floréal Year XII (May 18, 1804), also known as the Constitution of Year XII. The senatus-consultum entrusted the government of the Republic to the First Consul Bonaparte, who was given the title of Emperor of the French Napoléon I. The imperial succession was proclaimed as hereditary applying to the direct, natural, and legitimate descendants of Napoléon Bonaparte. The new regime was formalized with Napoléon I&#x27;s coronation at Notre-Dame de Paris on December 2, 1804, and with the establishment of a court system, including great dignitaries, civil and military officers, eighteen marshals, and a nobility of the Empire, many of whose names are remembered in the nomenclature of Péron and Freycinet.</p><p>It ended in 1815 with the Restauration.</p>

        <p>The Seven Years&#x27; War (1754/1756–1763) was a global conflict involving most of the major European powers and many smaller European states, as well as nations in Asia and the Americas. The most powerful belligerents in each of the opposing alliances were Great Britain and France, both seeking to establish global dominance at the expense of the other power. Along with Spain, France fought Great Britain both in Europe and overseas with land-based armies and naval forces, while Britain&#x27;s ally Prussia sought territorial expansion in Europe and consolidation of its power. The conflict originated from unresolved issues left by the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), with Prussia seeking greater influence in the German states and Austria aiming to regain Silesia, captured by Prussia in the previous war and to contain Prussian influence. The long-standing colonial rivalries pitting Britain against France and Spain in North America and the West Indies were also fought on a grand scale, with France emerging from the conflict extremely weakened.</p>

Several savants and officers from the voyage, including the two captains, Baudin and Hamelin, as well as Péron, were among its correspondents.

        <p>In 1740, the death of Emperor Charles VI and the accession of his daughter Maria Theresa triggered the War of the Austrian Succession. Related princes claimed all or part of the empire, contesting the right of a woman to rule. France entered the war in 1741 by allying itself with Prussia against the Austrians, British, and Dutch. The final period was marked by French victories. The war ended in 1748 with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Louis XV returned his conquests to Austria, to the general surprise and dismay of his people, declaring that he had concluded peace ‘as a king and not as a merchant.’ Prussia was the great winner of the conflict, having enlarged its kingdom at the expense of Austria. Empress Maria Theresa reluctantly accepted it. The conflict resumed in 1756, triggering the Seven Years&#x27; War. Names of French personalities such as Dupleix, the governor of Pondicherry and of the French establishments in India, who had long collected strategic information on the English trading post&#x27;s defense capabilities and prepared an attack plan, are remembered in the nomenclature of Péron and Freycinet</p>

Le sacre et le couronnement eurent lieu à Notre‑Dame de Paris (2 décembre 1804), en présence de Pie VII ; Napoléon se couronna lui‑même et couronna l’impératrice Joséphine.</p>
                <p>Le régime, d’inspiration monarchique, institua une Cour, de hautes dignités, dix‑huit maréchaux et une noblesse d’Empire. Il s’acheva en 1815 avec la Restauration.</p>

                <p>Fondée en 1799 par des savants proches du courant des Idéologues (naturalistes, médecins, philosophes, orientalistes, etc.), la Société s’intéressa à l’anthropologie naissante et suivit avec attention les apports possibles du voyage de Baudin. Baudin, Hamelin et Péron comptèrent parmi ses correspondants. Dissoute en 1804 par Bonaparte pour motifs politiques.</p>

                <p>À la mort de l’empereur Charles VI (1740) et à l’accession de sa fille, Marie‑Thérèse, plusieurs princes contestèrent les droits de cette dernière, déclenchant la guerre. La France entra en 1741 aux côtés de la Prusse contre l’Autriche, la Grande‑Bretagne et les Provinces‑Unies. Le conflit s’acheva par la paix d’Aix‑la‑Chapelle (1748).</p>
                <p>La Prusse sortit renforcée ; les rivalités coloniales franco‑britanniques reprirent et débouchèrent en 1756 sur la guerre de Sept Ans. La toponymie conserve des noms de personnalités françaises engagées outre‑mer (par ex. Dupleix à Pondichéry).</p>
