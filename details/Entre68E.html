    This French expedition was commanded by Yves Joseph de Kerguelen de Trémarec (1734–1797), entrusted by King Louis XVI to search for the unknown Southern Land. Kerguelen was sailing in La Fortune, and his second in command, Louis-Francois de Saint-Aloüarn, was captaining the gabarre Le Gros Ventre. The two ships became separated in the Indian Ocean. Kerguelen discovered a fog-shrouded island in the southern Indian Ocean and, believing it to be the unknown land, sailed back to France to report his discovery. The island group now bears his name. Following his instructions, Saint-Aloüarn continued to sail east and made landfall on the western Australian coast close to Cape Leeuwin, on the 17 March 1772. During the seventeenth century the Dutch and the British explorer Dampier (1651–1715) had already visited this coast, then referred to as New-Holland. Following the coast to the north, Saint-Aloüarn anchored at Dirk Hartog Island, where he named pointe des Hauts fonds, the most northern cape of this peninsula. He organized a ceremony to claim possession of the land and another to bury one of his crew members, Massicot, who had likely died of scurvy. As a sign of remembrance, based on the journal of Sergeant Lafortune and mentioned by Godard and Kerros, Massicot’s name was given to the bay where he was buried; However, this place name was never adopted in the French atlases published by later voyages that visited the west coast of Australia. Then, Saint-Aloüarn sailed north as far as Melville Island. He died, as well as his second in command, a few days after their return to Isle de France. No action was taken by the French king to take possession of the land. In 1998, a 1767 French écu and a broken bottle from this expedition were discovered on a cliff top at Dirk Hartog Island, along with a second bottle containing another écu, partially sealed with a lead capsule. The first ecu was found in January by an expedition led by M. Philippe Godard and including members of the Batavia Coast Maritime Heritage Group from Geraldton. Then, ‘in collaboration with the Centre for Archaeology at the University of Western Australia, the Western Australian Museum fielded an archaeological expedition to the site in March - April 1998 that uncovered the French wine bottle, sealed with lead encapsulating another French écu dated 1767’. See the pictures of the bottle and the ecus in the WAM collections.
