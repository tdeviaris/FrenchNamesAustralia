    Longboats commanded by M. de Saint-Aignan, lieutenant of the Recherche, and M. de La Seinie, lieutenant of the Espérance, were sent out with the mission of exploring the various branches of the channel. I was granted the privilege of taking part in these explorations. The sea arm into which we ventured stretched as far as the eye could see to the northwest. It would have taken several days to chart it fully. The breeze, however, favored us, and we quickly made headway against the current. Everywhere the sounding line found ten to twelve fathoms of water. The coast to our left rose gradually, crowned with gigantic trees less dense than in other parts of the shoreline. From time to time clearings opened up, promising easy access inland. Captivated by this view, we drew closer to the shore and searched for the most suitable spot to beach our boat, as the day was already declining. To our great surprise, we recognized that, over a considerable stretch, the shoreline consisted of a single, very even rock, rising only a few inches above sea level and giving every appearance of a vast quay prepared by human hands. At the foot of this natural masterpiece, we found no less than nine fathoms of water over a muddy bottom. The largest vessels could have moored there or rested in the dry dock, without the slightest danger.” —Souvenirs d’un amiral, Vol. 1, pp. 106–107 At the end of his chapter on Tasmania, he proudly emphasizes the importance of the exploration work carried out by the d’Entrecasteaux expedition: “Europe would come to know that, at no point in the world, were there coasts more finely indented, harbors more spacious, or ports easier to access than at the southern extremity of Van Diemen’s Land.” Yet he adds with much bitterness: “At the head of Storm Bay, on the right bank of this sea arm whose chart we drew the following year, now stands the capital of Tasmania, the flourishing town of Hobart. Picturesque villages cover the hills, fields heavy with crops have replaced the forests, and numerous ships crowd the mouth of the Derwent, that ungrateful river which has not retained the name we gave it. Our predictions for the future of this magnificent land have come true—but not, as we had every right to hope, for the benefit of France.” —p. 119
