    Péron studied chemistry and pharmacology under Fourcroy after the latter’s appointment as professor of chemistry in Paris at the Jardin du Roi, which was renamed the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle following the French Revolution (see this entry in the glossary)Fourcroy held public offices with the revolutionary government and has been accused of involvement in Lavoisier’s arrest and death, although his participation has not been proved. He was appointed by Bonaparte to the State Council (Section of the Interior ministry) and was in charge of creating and organizing an effective and efficient public education system, of primary schools, colleges and lycées (high schools), specialized schools (medicine, chemistry etc..) and universities. It was to Fourcroy that Péron addressed his ‘Memoir on the English settlements in New Holland, in the land of Diemen and in the archipelagoes of the great Pacific Ocean’, which describes these territories from a colonial perspective. Jean Fornasiero and John West Sooby wrote on the subject of this memoir that: ‘As fate would have it, Péron would in a few short years have the opportunity of emulating the political activism of his masters, for it is to this selfsame Fourcroy, in his capacity as Counsellor of State, that Francois Péron, on his return from the Antipodes, would address a report that had nothing to do with chemistry and everything to do with politics’.

    Further information: Baudin called the island ‘Isle aux alouettes’, because the crew ‘caught a lark that came and rested on the ship while we were abeam to it’, p.374. A cape in the Northern Territory has also been named after Fourcroy. To the Gunditjmara and Eastern Maar people, the island is where the spirits of the dead go before journeying to their next destination in the afterlife.
