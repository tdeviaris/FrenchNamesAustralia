      At the time, it was
common practice among the nobility and the landed gentry to attach to
their family name that of the château or the land they owned and
occupied, preceeded by the preposition de, or d’ before a vowel,
(of). In the commanders case, the Bruny family owned the marquisate
of Entrecasteaux in Provence.

      With the
French Revolution and the abolition of the noble priviledges, the
spelling of the commander’s name changed: Towards the end of the
voyage, in late 1793, and after the death of d’Entrecasteaux in New
Guinea in July of that year, the newly formed republican government
in France, directed by the

which debarred members of the nobility from serving in the French
navy, while, in general, the old French aristocraty became the target
of the Terror (see the glossary). To avoid being identified as a
noble and to acknowledge the social changes, aristocratic families
with a double name deleted ‘de’ or d’ from their surnames. In
the case of the commander’s name only the removal of the apostrophe
was needed. In the narrative and on the charts of the atlas of the
voyage, his name was changed to Bruny-Dentrecasteaux. However, in the

     In his journal, D’Entrecasteaux
reported that his expedition in search for La Pérouse had first
planned to anchor at Adventure Bay, discovered by Tobias Furneaux in
1773, when in command of Captain Cook’s companion ship, the HMS
     <i>
      Adventure
     </i>
     , during the latter’s second voyage. However, since
the survey reports of his officer de Cretin, and his engineer
geographer Beautemps-Beaupré seemed ‘to indicate the entrance of a
very deep channel’, d’Entrecasteaux decided to send parties to
check their findings, before resuming his itinerary.

     The journals of Labillardière
and Ventenat give a different version that explains why, instead of
anchoring at Adventure Bay, the expedition explored what is now the
D’Entrecasteaux Channel. As Labillardière stated: ‘… Willaumez
was directed to take the necessary observations. On being asked the
bearing of Eddy-stone, he said it bore S.19˚W, though it bore 19˚E.
Accordingly the Commander gave orders to head for the bay on our
left, as he could not doubt that it was Adventure Bay.’
Labillardière, in his journal, reminded readers that ‘as his [the
commander’s] injuries (broken ribs, see section 2.2) did not permit
him to leave his cabin, he was obliged to give his order respecting
our route, according to observations which were reported to him as
they were taken, [including] the incorrect bearings given by
Willaumez’.

d'Entrecasteaux
     <span lang="fr-FR">
      noted in his journal that the
party who did the first reconnaissance ‘of this so vast and so
secure anchorage’, where ‘all the navies of the world could
gather’, came back ‘with cries of joy’.
