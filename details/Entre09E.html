    The expedition’s most important discovery was that of the D'Entrecasteaux Channel, a narrow passage of the sea that separates south easten Tasmania from Bruny Island. This important navigational route now bears the name of the voyage’s commander, Antoine Raymond Joseph Bruny d'Entrecasteaux (1737-1793). At the time, it was common practice among the nobility and the landed gentry to attach to their family name that of the château or the land they owned and occupied, preceeded by the preposition de, or d’ before a vowel, (of). In the commanders case, the Bruny family owned the marquisate of Entrecasteaux in Provence. With the French Revolution and the abolition of the noble priviledges, the spelling of the commander’s name changed: Towards the end of the voyage, in late 1793, and after the death of d’Entrecasteaux in New Guinea in July of that year, the newly formed republican government in France, directed by the Comité de Salut Public, issued a decree (decret de l’An II de la République) which debarred members of the nobility from serving in the French navy, while, in general, the old French aristocraty became the target of the Terror (see the glossary). To avoid being identified as a noble and to acknowledge the social changes, aristocratic families with a double name deleted ‘de’ or d’ from their surnames. In the case of the commander’s name only the removal of the apostrophe was needed. In the narrative and on the charts of the atlas of the voyage, his name was changed to Bruny-Dentrecasteaux. However, in the 19th century, the orignal spelling was restored to d’Entrecasteaux (in French, the preposition de or d apostrophy does not need a capital letter like in English). The choice of d’Entrecasteaux as Commander in chief of the expedition in search of La Pérouse by the Assemblée Nationale in February 1791 was prompted by d’Entrecasteaux naval experience and his bold but successful navigation in uncharted waters on the way to China, where he sailed against the monsoon to reach Canton on La Résolution (1785-1789). In his journal, D’Entrecasteaux reported that his expedition in search for La Pérouse had first planned to anchor at Adventure Bay, discovered by Tobias Furneaux in 1773, when in command of Captain Cook’s companion ship, the HMS Adventure, during the latter’s second voyage. However, since the survey reports of his officer de Cretin, and his engineer geographer Beautemps-Beaupré seemed ‘to indicate the entrance of a very deep channel’, d’Entrecasteaux decided to send parties to check their findings, before resuming his itinerary. The journals of Labillardière and Ventenat give a different version that explains why, instead of anchoring at Adventure Bay, the expedition explored what is now the D’Entrecasteaux Channel. As Labillardière stated: ‘… Willaumez was directed to take the necessary observations. On being asked the bearing of Eddy-stone, he said it bore S.19˚W, though it bore 19˚E. Accordingly the Commander gave orders to head for the bay on our left, as he could not doubt that it was Adventure Bay.’ Labillardière, in his journal, reminded readers that ‘as his [the commander’s] injuries (broken ribs, see section 2.2) did not permit him to leave his cabin, he was obliged to give his order respecting our route, according to observations which were reported to him as they were taken, [including] the incorrect bearings given by Willaumez’. Be that as it may, d'Entrecasteaux noted in his journal that the party who did the first reconnaissance ‘of this so vast and so secure anchorage’, where ‘all the navies of the world could gather’, came back ‘with cries of joy’. In his journal, d’Entrecasteaux referred to the canal as ‘the channel situated in the southern part of Van Diemen’s Land’. The name ‘canal d’Entrecasteaux’ was given to it after the death of the Commander, when Rossel* and Beautemps-Beaupré* were working at the edition of the atlas.
