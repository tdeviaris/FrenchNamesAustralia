    This print depicts the removal in 1814 from the top of the triumphal column on the Place Vendôme, of the statue of Napoléon portrayed as a roman emperor (like the Trajan column), at the time of the Restauration of the monarchy, with Louis XVIII. The statue was replaced by a flag with a fleur de lys. Then, in 1831, the flag was replaced by king Louis Philippe with a new statue representing Bonaparte as corporal, instead of emperor By Opiz, Georg-Emmanuel (1775-1841). Graveur

    Printed a few decades later, this image illustrates the reinstallation of a statue identical to the original one (Napoléon emperor), on the top of the triumphal column on the Place Vendôme  during the reign of Napoléon’s nephew, Napoléon III. This later statue was torn down during the Commune, in 1871, and a final statue was once more erected during the IIIrd Republic (1870-1940). By Roevens, E, Deroy and Lix, F

    The Place Vendôme, developed in Paris during the reign of Louis XIV, was named in honor of this lineage. It was designed as a symbol of monarchical and aristocratic prestige. The vast space is surrounded by architecturally imposing buildings in the neo-classical style, constructed in the late 17th and 18th centuries, and has at its centre a tall column, ordered by Napoléon, and built under the supervision of Vivan Denon* with a statue of Napoléon at the top. The bronze used in its manufacture came from captured Austrian and Russian canons, to commemorate the battle of Austerlitz in 1805. The column received the name of ‘Austerlitz’, then ‘Victory’ before becoming ‘column of the Great Army’. The statue was unbolted at the time of the fall of Napoléon 1st in 1814, restored on several occasions, unbolted again in 1871, then rebuilt at the end of the XIX century. It was only after the fall of Napoléon that it gradually took on the name of ‘colonne Vendôme’.
