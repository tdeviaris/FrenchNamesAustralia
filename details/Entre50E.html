    Marc-Joseph Marion Dufresne (1724–1772), a trader and planter based in Isle de France (Mauritius), served as an officier bleu in the French Royal Navy and as a captain for the French East India Company. At the invitation of the island’s administrator, Pierre Poivre, he set sail on 18 October 1771 with two ships—le Marquis de Castries and le Mascarin. The expedition had two main objectives. The first was to return the Polynesian Aotourou to his homeland. Aotourou had been brought to France from Tahiti by Bougainville, who later arranged for his return by sending him to Isle de France, with instructions to Poivre to organize the final leg of the journey eastward to Tahiti. Tragically, Aotourou died of smallpox in Madagascar on 6 November 1771, before the plan could be completed. The second objective was to explore the southern reaches of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. While Marion Dufresne continued his exploratory route to the Pacific, his two ships collided, causing considerable damage. The commander decided to land on the eastern coast of Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania, 4 March 1772) to re-mast one of the ships and replenish them with fresh water. He encountered Aboriginal Tasmanians, but the meeting turned ugly due to misunderstandings. As a result, stones were thrown at the crew and the Aborigines were fired on, with at least one of them being killed. Julien Crozet, Marion’s second-in-command, suggests in his narrative of the voyage that, after the encounter between two unarmed (in fact, naked) French sailors and an old Tasmanian man, the arrival of other longboats from the French vessel undermined the inhabitants’confidence who attempted to prevent the French from disembarking by throwing stones and spears.

    Marion Dufresne, with some of his companions, was himself killed a few weeks later by Maoris in New-Zealand. No Australian places were named or claimed by the French during this voyage.
