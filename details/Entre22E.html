    D’Entrecasteaux dedicated the three prominent headlands on the southern part of Bruny Island, to his naturalists, One of them was Claude Antoine Gaspard Riche (1762-1797). In July 1791, in Paris, the Societé d’Histoire Naturelle (the most prominent scientific institution at the time) selected Claude Antoine Gaspard Riche (1762-1797) to join the d’Entrecasteaux expedition as naturalist. That Riche was, as Labillardière, an active members of this society helped in his selection. But his choice was mainly a result of his skills. Riche was born in the province of Beaujolais in France (north of Lyon). He was the brother of the highly regarded mathematician and engineer, Gaspard Clair François Marie Riche de Prony* (see entry Cap Prony in SA). Like his fellow naturalist, Labillardière, Riche studied medicine but soon developed an interest in botany and geology. In 1791, he joined the d’Entrecasteaux expedition as a naturalist on L’Espérance. His main contributions to the expeditions work were in the fields of mineralogy and the study of birds and protozoan animals. Labillardière greatly esteemed his colleague and his passion for science. He expressed his regard for him by naming a Tasmanian plant ‘which has never before been discovered … Richea, after Citizen Riche, one of the naturalists of the expedition. This philosopher fell victim to his love for science having made, when already in a very advanced stage of consumption [tuberculosis] a long and fatiguing journey, in which he had more regard for his scientific zeal than the state of his health…’  p.133. Riche died soon after his return to France.

    In Tasmania, dedicating the three prominent headlands on the southern part of Bruny Island to his naturalists, D’Entrecasteaux named Pointe Riche. In Western Australia, Cape Riche was also named after the naturalist, after he caused great anxiety for his commander when on the 14th of December 1792, he went ashore for a two-hour stay but was not seen again for two days. According to his own report, he ‘walked on with a few other persons…stopping at each step of this new land for some observations or for collecting … when I [Riche] lost sight of the others.’ In fact, Riche ‘had declined to be followed by his servant, who, on his return, addressed him with the most moving reproaches with tears in his eyes’. Riche’s unexpectedly extended exploration of the land allowed him to report on his finding of ‘a mass of petrified wood’. From his observations he concluded ‘this destroyed forest occupied the whole coast, and seemed to have extended to the dunes. The ancients could have regarded this as the vestige of a once fertile Gorgon valley’ (Riche refers here to Greek mythologogy, according to which Gorgons turned their human prey to stone). Riche encountered salt lakes which he assumed to be linked to the sea. He also discovered swampy valleys with ‘many different kinds of birds’, including Galahs. He ‘saw many places where the natives had built fires’ and wondered for what reasons would they build large fires all day in such a hot climate. He mentions that ‘some travellers have declared that the inhabitants tried to protect themselves from the importunity of moquitoes; these insects bothered me a great deal in fact…’
