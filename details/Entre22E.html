     in SA). Like his fellow naturalist,
Labillardière, Riche studied medicine but soon developed an interest
in botany and geology. In 1791, he joined the d’Entrecasteaux
expedition as a naturalist on
     <i>
      L’Espérance
     </i>
     . His main
contributions to the expeditions work were in the fields of
mineralogy and the study of birds and protozoan animals.
Labillardière greatly esteemed his colleague and his passion for
science.

        He
expressed his regard for him by naming a Tasmanian plant ‘which has
never before been discovered … Richea, after Citizen Riche, one of
the naturalists of the expedition. This philosopher fell victim to
his love for science having made, when already in a very advanced
stage of consumption [tuberculosis] a long and fatiguing journey, in
which he had more regard for his scientific zeal than the state of
his health…’  p.133. Riche

     In Western Australia, Cape
Riche was also named after the naturalist, after he caused great
anxiety for his commander when on the 14th of December 1792, he went
ashore for a two-hour stay but was not seen again for two days.
According to his own report, he ‘walked on with a few other
persons…stopping at each step of this new land for some
observations or for collecting … when I [Riche] lost sight of the
others.’ In fact, Riche ‘had declined to be followed by his
servant, who, on his return, addressed him with the most moving
reproaches with tears in his eyes’. Riche’s unexpectedly extended
exploration of the land allowed him to report on his finding of ‘a
mass of petrified wood’. From his observations he concluded ‘this
destroyed forest occupied the whole coast, and seemed to have
extended to the dunes. The ancients could have regarded this as the
vestige of a once fertile Gorgon valley’ (Riche refers here to
Greek mythologogy, according to which Gorgons turned their human prey
to stone). Riche encountered salt lakes which he assumed to be linked
to the sea. He also discovered swampy valleys with ‘many different
kinds of birds’, including Galahs. He ‘saw many places where the
natives had built fires’ and wondered for what reasons would they
build large fires all day in such a hot climate. He mentions that
‘some travellers have declared that the inhabitants tried to
protect themselves from the importunity of moquitoes; these insects
bothered me a great deal in fact…’
