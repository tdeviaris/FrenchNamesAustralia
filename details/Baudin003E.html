    Sea journal of Hamelin, commander of the "Naturaliste", an IX-an XI– entry 19-20 Germinal An 10, with his mission order addressed to Milius, Faure, Brévedent and Leschénault to hydrograph, chart and explore Port Western Source: Archives Nationales de France/ Marine 5JJ/42/ Piece 172, Cahier (book) 2 Excerpts from “Report by Commander Pierre Milius on the mission to Port Western, located on the southern coast of New Holland” ANF/MAR/5JJ/53 On the 19th of Germinal, having arrived at 28°46' south latitude and 143°37' east longitude from the Paris meridian, we caught sight of the island located at the entrance to Western Port: the weather was fine and the wind light; Commander Hamelin decided to send out a reconnaissance party to visit the port, with a view to anchoring there if circumstances so required, and I was ordered to go there to make the necessary observations for piloting the ship. Engineer and geographer Faure was tasked with mapping it, and I was to take care of the soundings and surveys; botanist Leschenault asked for and obtained permission to accompany me... ...I set sail and signaled the small boat commanded by Midshipman Brévédent to pass by. I ordered him to head for the eastern part of the island and investigate the passage that the English had closed off with a sandbar: the current I had observed during the night led me to believe that there must be an opening that communicated with the north... ...the entire southern part of the island is bordered by reefs, the sea rolls incessantly onto a sandy beach...and causes a terrible noise... The land surrounding the large basin...is low-lying and, as in the entire expanse of the harbor, covered with trees that even reach into the water... This part of New Holland is sparsely inhabited. I discovered a column of smoke in the large basin... I approached it and heard the cries of the natives who were signaling me to come to them, and from their gestures, I understood that they were showing me the place where I could land conveniently; I landed on this coast and went down to the shore accompanied by the botanist Leschenault; I ordered the two canoes not to run aground, and I kept everyone on board so as not to frighten these peaceful inhabitants with our numbers; Citizen Leschenault and I sat down at the foot of a cliff... and we signaled them to come to us, showing them signs of friendship; they responded to our invitation with the utmost mistrust, none of them dared to come down, even though they had called us!... They chatted for a long time without us being able to understand what they wanted; nevertheless, believing that they were inviting us to leave our clothes behind and climb the cliff to join them, I took off my pants and shirt, which seemed to satisfy them. I then began to climb the cliff, and as it was steep, they indicated that I should hold on to the grass; I gestured to them in vain, inviting them to come and give me a hand, but they remained distrustful. Finally, when I was about to reach the same level as them, I pretended that I could no longer climb and stretched out an arm toward them as if to beg them to save me, but none of these unfortunate people came forward to help me. In short, when I reached this height, they all spoke to me at once while moving away from me. I could see that my pants and shoes impressed them and that they wanted to see me naked like them, so I decided to take them off. I took out my watch, which they noticed and cried out in surprise. I showed them the sun and traced its daily movement on the ground, which they seemed to understand. I gave them my pants and shoes, which they carefully picked up and wrapped up, and they motioned for me to follow them to get warm and eat. I showed them how much I disliked walking barefoot and let myself fall to the ground to show them that my shoes were absolutely necessary. One of them then pulled up a blade of dry grass and placed his palm on it, no doubt to indicate that the path was fine and that I had nothing to fear. They looked at me a lot and seemed quite satisfied to see me with forms similar to theirs. They made a few movements to encourage me to imitate them, and when I did so, they showed their joy by laughing. They asked to see my mouth by showing me theirs, which I could see clearly, so I did the same and they laughed again... but I couldn't get closer than a step and a half or two, as the slightest movement on my part made them disappear... Conclusion Western Port, located on the southern coast of New Holland, could be of great interest to a nation wishing to establish a settlement on this coast; but it would first be necessary to search the bottom of the basin to find a freshwater ravine... Port Western can be considered an excellent stopover for a ship that, while exploring, has suffered major damage... and is forced to seek shelter from bad weather. The bottom is generally sandy everywhere... Outside this basin, exiting through the small passage, there are several sources of running water flowing among the large granite rocks that border Western Isle. Aboard the corvette Le Naturaliste on 27 Germinal, Year 10. The frigate captain signs Milius.
