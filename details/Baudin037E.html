    Freycinet described the coastline as perilous, marked by a cluster of rocks offshore and coves ill-suited for anchorage. Baudin, in his journal, provided further details about the dangers of these shores. On 6 April 1802, he wrote: “This inlet ends in a prominent cape, at the extremity of which lies a small island [Godfrey Island] extending about half a league out to sea. Its southeastern part is low and narrow, but the northern section rises higher and can be seen from some distance. The island is surrounded on all sides by breakers and is therefore difficult to approach. The same applies to the entire coast, which is protected by a reef and a chain of rocks of varying height that make any landing impossible. After rounding this island, our course took a more northerly direction than before; to continue following the coast, we steered for some time north-northwest, altering our route only to avoid a few breakers that occasionally extend far out to sea. At noon, we could not take the sun, although the weather was fairly clear. By our reckoning, we were at 37°27’. Around three o’clock, we sighted an underwater reef lying about half a league from the coast. We saw it rather late—it was already abeam when it was spotted from the deck. We immediately tacked to port on a south-southeast wind to move away from it. Even so, we passed no more than a mile from it, in ten fathoms of water, over a hard rocky bottom.” A few days later, when Baudin met Matthew Flinders, he warned the British navigator about these treacherous rocks. Flinders subsequently marked them on his chart as the “Baudin Rocks.” Thus, the name Baudin appeared for the first time not on the French charts of the voyage of discovery, but on those of the Investigator expedition.

    Further information: Baudin named the cove that formed the Eastern part of this bay anse des Albatros (Albatross cove).
