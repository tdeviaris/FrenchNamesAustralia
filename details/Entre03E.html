    In this sketch, Beautemps-Beaupré named the two ports of the bay A and B, as it is the commander who has the authority to name the places.

    Baie de la Recherche was the first Australian bay that the expedition ‘discovered’ and, more generally, the first ‘discovery’ of the voyage. The bay was visited twice: first, from 21 April to 16 May 1792; and second, from 21 January to 13 February 1793. Naming what appeared to be an important discovery after the first ship to visit it was standard European practice. In 1773, for example, the British captain Tobias Furneaux named a bay on nearby Bruny Island after his ship, the Adventure. It is interesting to note that, in this first coastal sketch, Beautemps-Beaupré designated the two ports of the bay as A and B, since it was the commander who held the authority to name places. The vessel la Recherche, formerly la Truite (The Trout), was built in 1787 and was used mainly for transporting wood for use in construction. It was approximatively 36 metres in length and 9.10 meters wide, with a draught of less than 2.5 meters. The alterations made during the ship’s fitting-out included the construction of an orlop deck, the clearing of part of the gundeck for cannons, the addition of a poop cabin for the captain’s use on the after quarterdeck, and the doubling and nailing of the hull. The main innovation was in the galleys, which were built of iron instead of brick and designed to burn coal rather than wood. The crew was composed of one hundred and thirteen people at the time of the expedition’s departure and was captained by Antoine Raymond Joseph de Bruni d’Entrecasteaux. D’Entrecasteaux considered Recherche Bay as a haven which was ‘one of the most practical and the safest’. He highlighted that it ‘contrasts strongly with the name given to the bay next to, but hidden from it [Storm Bay, the name given to it in 1642 by the Dutch navigator Abel Tasman]’, pointing out that ‘the water is so calm, that the most violent winds barely disturb its surface; the frailest craft could sail at on it at any time…The plans drawn by M.Beautemps-Beaupré, the expedition’s chief engineer, assisted by the officers and M. Jouvency*, second engineer, will provide details of this port and of the bay, at the end of which it is situated.’ (plate 4 in the Atlas of the voyage,

    ). During the first stop in 1792, the scholars busied themselves along the shores: three tents were set up for astronomical observations, while the naturalists went out to collect flora. During the second stop in 1793, the naturalists met with the Aboriginal inhabitants in encounters described as friendly and even very cordial. The only problem encountered by d’Entrecasteaux and his officers was the muddy bottoms into which the anchors sank, and which made it difficult to haul them in. During the second stop, they encountered natives.
