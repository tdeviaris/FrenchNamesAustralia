    It was the first Australian bay that the expedition ‘discovered’ and, more generally, the first ‘discovery’ of the voyage. The bay was visited twice: first, from 21 April to 16 May 1792; second, from 21January to 13 February 1793. The naming of what appeared to be an important discovery after the name of the first ship that visited it, was standard European practice: In 1773, for example, the British Captain Tobias Furneaux had named a bay on nearby Bruny Island after his ship the Adventure. The vessel la Recherche, formerly la Truite (The Trout), was built in 1787 and was used mainly for transporting wood for use in construction. It was approximatively 36 metres in length and 9.10 meters wide, with a draught of less than 2.5 meters. The crew was composed of one hundred and thirteen people at the time of the expedition’s departure and was captained by Antoine Raymond Joseph de Bruni d’Entrecasteaux. D’Entrecasteaux considered Recherche Bay as a haven which was ‘one of the most practical and the safest’. He highlighted that it ‘contrasts strongly with the name given to the bay next to, but hidden from it [Storm Bay, the name given to it in 1642 by the Dutch navigator Abel Tasman]’, pointing out that ‘the water is so calm, that the most violent winds barely disturb its surface; the frailest craft could sail at on it at any time…The plans drawn by M.Beautemps-Beaupré, the expedition’s chief engineer, assisted by the officers and M. Jouvency*, second engineer, will provide details of this port and of the bay, at the end of which it is situated.’ (plate 4 in the Atlas of the voyage,

    ). During the first stop in 1792, the scholars busied themselves along the shores: three tents were set up for astronomical observations, while the naturalists went out to collect flora. During the second stop in 1793, the naturalists met with the Aboriginal inhabitants in encounters described as friendly and even very cordial. The only problem encountered by d’Entrecasteaux and his officers was the muddy bottoms into which the anchors sank, and which made it difficult to haul them in.
