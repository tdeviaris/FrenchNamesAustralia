    During his five days February 1793 mission (see entry Rivière du Nord), sailing north after the discovery of the River Derwent’s estuary and ports, Willaumez* and his longboat party ‘turned into a deep bay’, which d’Entrecasteaux named Baie du Nord. It is located immediately to the west of a smaller bay discovered by Abel Tasman in 1642, to which he gave the name Frederick Henrik Bay. The French navigator and explorer Marion du Fresne anchored his ship in this bay in 1772. One of the orders Willaumez had received from his commander was to establish whether a channel connected any of the northern bays he was asked to explore with the bay Tasman that Marion Dufresne had visited. Unfortunately, bad weather prevented him from sailing his longboat far enough eastwards. Had he been able to do so, he would have found that only a narrow strip of land separated the Baie du Nord from Tasman’s Frederick Henrik Bay. The first English navigator in Tasmanian water, Tobias Furneaux, in 1773, wrongly identified the entrance to Williaumez’s ‘deep bay’ as the Frederick Henrik Bay which Tasman had mapped some 130 years earlier, and entered the name on his chart in the anglisised version of the original Dutch as Frederick Henry Bay. It is this name which the bay bears today. The bay Tasman had discovered now has two names, Blackman Bay for its larger southern part and Marion Bay for its smaller northern portion. Two of the promomtories charted by Willaumez in the Baie du Nord were given the names of the expedition’s surgeons, Pierre Renard (?-1798),  the expedition’s surgeon major on La Recherche and Denis Joannet (1748-?), the acting surgeon on l’Espérance. Labillardière recounts an anecdote of a dispute in April 1792 in the d’Entrecasteaux channel between an unnamed servant of the naturalist Riche and  the surgeon Renard, which revealed that the egalitarian principles of the French Revolution were not always observed during the voyage, at least not where servants were concerned, even though both Renard and Riche were republicans. According to Labillardière, Riche’s servant had killed some birds and happily carried them back to his master. However, as he was just recovering from an illness, Renard claimed to have a prior right to the birds.When the servant refused to hand them over, Renard took his revenge by putting him on a rough diet and made him swallow a strong, quite unpleasant purgative. Towards the end of the voyage, Renard also seems to have had grievances against the second surgeon on board the Esperance, a certain Mr R. Gauffre, who, at least according to Renard, refused to treat patients (Archives Nationales de France/MAR/5JJ/2, numbers 16-20). Joannet kept a very detailed journal of the illnesses and injuries on board the Espérance, together with the remedies he prescribed and surgeries he carried out. At times he also had challenging relationships with the naturalistes on board, who felt particularly offended by his claims that the navy minister and academicians considered him a naturalist in their correspondance, and that he had a good knowledge of botany, especially as he had to use plants to cure his patients. Labillardière related that on the coasts of the d’Entrecasteaux channel, Joannet fell into a deep clay pond that was hidden under overlaying plants, but he knew how to swim and that saved him.

    Located close to the entrance of the bay, Île St Aignan bears the name of Lieutenant Alexandre Francois de la Fresnaye de Saint-Aignan (1768-1849). Saint-Aignan was the name of his estate in Normandy. He had sailed under the command of d’Entrecasteaux on la Résolution before his appointment to La Recherche. Saint-Aignan was promoted lieutenant (Navy) in February 1793, during the second reconnaissance of the d’Entrecasteaux channel.
