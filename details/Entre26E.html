    In February 1793, following the orders from his commander, Captain Huon de Kermadec* sent out a party to survey and chart an indentation in the coast located in the northwest of the D’Entrecasteaux Channel. Huon placed his engineer geographer, Jouvency* in charge of this task. The commander later named this bay Port du Nord Ouest (Northwest Bay), and the promontory at its southwestern entrance Pointe Gicquel, after one of his officers. Pierre-Guillaume Gicquel Destouches (1770–1824) enlisted as a ‘volontaire’ (volunteer) on la Recherche. Gicquel was promoted to ‘enseigne’ (sub-lieutenant) in February 1793, in recognition of his surveying skills that greatly supported the work of Beautemps-Beaupré and Rossel. It is possible that Gicquel’s promotion was celebrated with the naming of the headland in his honour. Another promontory, on the east-northeast entrance of the bay, was named after the Benedictine chaplain Ambroise Pierson (1765–94) who served as astronomer, first on l’Espérance and later in the voyage on the la Recherche. To measure longitude and latitude, Pierson was using a marine chronometer made by the instrument maker Lenoir*, with the registration number 10. He was continually testing the steadiness and accuracy of the chronometer’s motion. To carry out his observations, he also used also a reflexive cercle (a graduated circular instrument like a theodolite to take angle and duplicate their measurements, thus enabling them to be checked), and a tilt compass. During the expedition’s two stopovers in the D’Entrecasteaux channel, Pierson organised the moving of the astronomical and surveying instruments to the shore where an observatory was set up for astronomical observations to calculate latitudes and longitudes from the angles between the sun and specific stars, or the sun and the moon. His results were compared to the ones calculated at the nearby observatory set up by l’Espérance’s consort, La Recherche*, to allow for comparison and corrections (as in the Baie de la Recherche*). Pierson may have sworn allegiance to the civil constitution of the clergy during the French Revolution, but it has been reported that thanks to his ‘gentleness’ he had good relationships with every member of the crew from all sides of the political spectrum.
