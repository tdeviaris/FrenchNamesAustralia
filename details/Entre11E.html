That Labillardière was an active member of this society helped in
their selection. But their choice was mainly a result of his
aptitude, as Labillardière was a highly trained naturalist.

     La Billardière. After completing a degree
in medicine, Labillardière opted to take up a career in the natural
sciences. He spent almost two years in Britain studying plants in
cultivation and established a firm friendship with Sir Joseph Banks.
In later years he visited Mediterranean countries and the Near East
to collect plants.

     on his excursions, Labillardière
expressed his ‘admiration at the sight of these ancient forests, in
which the sound of the axe has never been heard … contemplating the
prodigious size of these trees … the most luxuriant vigour of
vegetation…’. He ‘discovered … a new [to Europeans] species
of parsley, which I [Labillardière] named apium prostratum, on
account of the position of its stem which always creeps along the
ground. Its analogy with the other species of the same genus let me
to think it might be good to eat, and it answered my expectations. We
carried a large quantity of it on board with us, which was acceptable
to mariners who felt the necessity to reduce, by vegetable diet, the
bad effects of the salt provisions on which we had lived during the
whole of our passage from the Cape of Good Hope to that of Van
Diemen’. He also found a species of Eucalypt that he named
Eucalyptus globulus (the Tasmanian blue gum) that the carpenters
employed for their repairs on the vessels. Labillardière commented
that this eucalypt ‘is one of the tallest in nature … the trunk,
which is very straight, … might be usefully employed in
shipbuilding, especially for masts, although it is neither so light
nor so elastic as that of the pine tree. Possibly it might be of
advantage to construct masts of different pieces of timber and even
perforate the large trunks of trees throughout their whole length, so
far to render them lighter, and to give them strength by binding them
at equal distances with hoops of iron…’.
