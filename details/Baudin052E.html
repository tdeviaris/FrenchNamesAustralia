    Statue of Dupleix in today’s Goubert Avenue in Pondicherry, the statue was commissioned in 1870 at the time when the city was under French colonial administration and sculpted by Gruyère. Dupleix is seen holding a map of Pondicherry in his right hand, and his left hand hold the hilt of his sword.

    Further information: Baudin initially named the cape ‘Pointe de la Misère’ (Point of Misery), a designation that likely reflected the prevailing sentiment of bitterness and discouragement aboard his vessel following the encounter with Flinders. In his account, he noted: “In the afternoon, we were greatly hindered by the sudden drop in wind, which left us almost becalmed. However, the current served us reasonably well, though it carried us toward the mainland as it veered northwest. We passed close to a prominent headland, beyond which the coast appeared to extend north-northwest for about a league, with depths of 18 fathoms. The land here is of considerable elevation and offers a varied and picturesque landscape, yet it left us with the regret of being unable to make landfall, as the shore descends abruptly into the sea.” Baudin’s journal, Entry 9 April 1802
