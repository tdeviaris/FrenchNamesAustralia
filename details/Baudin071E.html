    Émilie du Châtelet engaged deeply with the works of Leibniz and Newton, whose competing theories represented one of the defining scientific debates of her era. In her Institutions de Physique, she meticulously elucidated Leibnizian physics, dedicating the work to her son as both an intellectual legacy and a pedagogical resource. Recognizing the importance of Newton’s contributions, she undertook the monumental task of translating his Principia Mathematica into French—a translation that remains the sole French version available to this day. Voltaire was her companion and intellectual collaborator for ten years.

    A second possibility is that the naming of the landmark relates to Dorothée de Courlande (1793-1862), a German princess, beautiful, rich, and intelligent, whom Talleyrand* chose to marry to his nephew in 1809. As Dorothée de Courlande was still very young when Péron was working at the nomenclature, this seems less likely. Dorothée may also refer to the name of one of the heroines in the short story written by Mme de Genlis, la femme auteur, published in 1806, dealing with the social obstacles put in place to prevent women from attaining their intellectual ambitions.

    Further information: When Freycinet and his crew reached the head of the Gulf of St Vincent, they hoped to discover the mouth of a major river. Instead, they encountered only low-lying, flooded shores devoid of any substantial estuary. In his notebook, the geographer of the Baudin expedition, Boullanger*, reported on 15–16 January 1803: « The head of this first gulf ends in such lowlands that, even in only 2 or 3 fathoms of water, we could see only drowned trees on the banks [in fact, Avicennia marina]. » At the time, neither he nor Freycinet could foresee that these apparently monotonous, waterlogged margins were in fact a mangrove environment of great ecological richness—an ecosystem whose scientific significance was entirely unknown to European observers of the early nineteenth century. Today, this mangrove within the Upper Gulf St Vincent Marine Park, together with the Light River Delta, is regarded as one of the most ecologically intact saltmarsh systems in South Australia.
