    Grandson of the Chancellor Henri François d’Aguesseau—renowned for his principled opposition to the financial system devised by the Scottish economist John Law, who sought to transform the French banking system—he pursued a career as a magistrate before serving as Ambassador to Denmark. He was appointed to the Académie française on 13 December 1787 to replace the Marquis de Paulmy, and was formally received by Nicolas Beauzée on 13 March 1788. Grimm recounts how this reception was expected to unfold: “Gentlemen,” d’Aguesseau will say, “I am here for my grandfather (grand-père).” — “And I,” Beauzée will reply, “am here for my grammar (grammaire).” In the eighteenth century, as in the seventeenth, grammaire was pronounced gran-maire, almost homophonous with grand-mère (“grandmother”), creating the same pun found in Molière’s Les Femmes savantes. D’Aguesseau was also a member of the Academy of Painting and Sculpture. He served as a deputy to the Estates-General, went into hiding during the Convention, and eventually became a senator and count of the Empire, a marquis, a peer of France, and Commander of the Order of the Holy Spirit under the Restoration. The Académie française was abolished during the Revolution and replaced by the Institut national under the Napoleonic reorganisation. In the reform of 1803, which reintegrated the Académie within the newly structured Institut, d’Aguesseau regained possession of his seat, having supported the project to re-establish the institution as early as 1800. He died as its senior member—the last surviving member of the former Académie and the final bearer of the d’Aguesseau name.
