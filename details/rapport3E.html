     Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
     Located on the western coast of Australia, at the entrance to Shark Bay, Cape Inscription is a singular site in maritime historical geography. Long before European arrivals, this coastline formed part of the territories traversed and inhabited by Aboriginal peoples, who maintained ancient, enduring, and structuring relationships with this coastal environment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although the name Cape Inscription was assigned by French navigators in the early nineteenth century, the promontory had already been visited by Dutch sailors during the Dutch Golden Age, as part of the major voyages of the Dutch East India Company. These European visits thus belong to a longer history in which, over more than two centuries, traces left by several generations of European navigators were superimposed. Through repeated acts of inscription—plates nailed to posts erected in rock fissures—the cape became a landmark that was at once nautical, memorial, and symbolic, revealing practices of exploration, recognition, and appropriation of coastal space.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Plate 1. 1616 — Dirk Hartog: the initial inscription
    </h3>

    </figure>
    <p>
     In 1616, the Dutch captain Dirk Hartog, commander of the ship Eendracht, reached the western coast of New Holland. At the top of the cape, he had a pewter plate fixed to a wooden post planted in a crack in the rock. The object bore an inscription mentioning the name of the ship, that of the captain, and the date of the stopover.
    </p>
    <p>
     This gesture, both simple and deliberate, constitutes the oldest known material trace of a European landing on the Australian coast. The inscription is not merely an individual testimony: it forms part of a maritime culture in which navigation is physically inscribed in space through objects intended to endure and to be found again.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Plate 2. 1697 — Willem de Vlamingh: substitution and continuity
    </h3>
    <figure>
     <img alt="Illustration" src="rapport3E_image2.jpg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
     On 4 February 1697, during an expedition commanded by Willem de Vlamingh, the plate left by Hartog was found. Aware of its historical value, de Vlamingh removed it and replaced it with a new pewter plate. On this new plate, the original inscription was copied along with an account of his own visit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hartog's plate was taken back to Amsterdam, while the cape retained, in renewed form, its function as a marker of European presence.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Plate 3. 1801 — Jacques-Felix-Emmanuel Hamelin: restoration and naming of the place
    </h3>
    <figure>
     <img alt="Illustration" src="rapport3E_image3.jpg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
     In July 1801, during the expedition commanded by Nicolas Baudin, Captain Jacques-Felix-Emmanuel Hamelin, commanding the corvette Le Naturaliste, intervened at the site in turn. Noting the degraded condition of the earlier installations, he had new wooden posts erected at the top of the cape and had Vlamingh's plate refixed there. He also added a new French inscription engraved on a sheet of lead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Through this intervention, the site was both restored and reinterpreted. The material act was accompanied by explicit naming: the place henceforth took the name Cape Inscription, consolidating in European eyes its status as a historical and memorial landmark.

    </p>
    <p class="excerpt-quote">
     The master made his report to me concerning what he had been able to observe with respect to the tide, and brought back a flattened pewter plate bearing an inscription left on Hartogs Island by the navigator commanding the Eendracht in 1616, and that engraved beneath it in 1697 by Vlaming, commander of the Geelvinck.
    </p>
    <p class="excerpt-quote">
     He found this sort of medal at the NE point, fallen at the foot of the post (now decayed) to which it had formerly been nailed.
    </p>
    <p class="excerpt-quote">
     Had this inscription still remained affixed to the post, I should have considered it a fault in the master of the helm to have laid sacrilegious hands upon it in order to detach it; but as he found it upon the ground, exposed to becoming buried there by its own weight, I was well pleased that he had brought it on board.
    </p>
    <p class="excerpt-quote">
     I ordered the master carpenter forthwith to prepare a post upon which I shall have it securely nailed, and I will send it to be erected at the very spot where, 181 years ago, it was placed by the Dutch navigator. It seems to me that monuments of this nature ought always to be held in respect…
    </p>
    <p class="excerpt-quote">
     At 10 p.m. I dispatched my boat under Midshipman Duval Dailly to convey to Dirk Hartog Island the naturalists Bailly and Bellefin, who are to carry out two days of investigations there.
    </p>
    <p class="excerpt-quote">
     At the same time I charged him to erect on the eastern coast of the said island, at one of its most conspicuous points, a post bearing the following inscription (upon a sheet of lead), copy of which follows:
    </p>
    <p class="excerpt-quote">

     Plate 4. 1818 — Louis de Freycinet: circulation of objects and knowledge
    </h3>
    <figure>
     <img alt="Illustration" src="rapport3E_image6.jpg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
     In 1818, Louis de Freycinet, former officer of Le Naturaliste, returned to Cape Inscription as part of his own expedition. He removed Vlamingh's plate, which was then transferred to France and integrated into national collections before being returned to Australia in 1947.
    </p>
    <p>
     This intervention marks a new stage: objects left the site to enter European scholarly and institutional circuits. The cape nonetheless remained a reference place, inscribed in a transnational network of knowledge, collections, and memories.
    </p>
    <h3>
     Plate 5. 1822 — Philip Parker King: the completed palimpsest
    </h3>
    <figure>
     <img alt="Illustration" src="rapport3E_image7.jpg"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
     In 1822, the British navigator Philip Parker King and his second-in-command, John Septimus Roe, in turn left a trace of their visit by forming their names with nails driven into the post erected by Hamelin. This discreet but durable gesture was added to earlier marks without erasing them.
    </p>
    <p>
     At this stage, Cape Inscription appears as a material palimpsest in which the different phases of European exploration of the Australian coast can be read in the superimposition of inscriptions.
