    It represents the empress in her garden of La Malmaison, that was at the time one of the most prestigious gardens in Europe. Prud’hon represents the empress nonchalantly sitting on a large rock, with a distant and dreamy expression. Her white dress, simple and with a wide-open neckline, inspired by Antiquity, and her diadem on her black curly hairs were typical of the beginning of the Empire. To view Prud’hon’s oil painting (1805) :

    The birth name of Joséphine was Marie-Joseph Rose de Tascher de la Pagerie (1763 – 1814). Though, she is mainly known by the nickname of Joséphine which Napoléon, her second husband, gave to her. She is also referred to as Joséphine de Beauharnais, after the name of her first husband, Alexandre de Beauharnais who was guillotined during the Terror in 1794. She was the empress of the French from the time of the coronation of Napoléon in 1804 to their divorce in 1809. Joséphine was a woman of influence who welcomed savants and voyagers, who provided her with exotic plants and animals which her visitors, among them foreign sovereigns, could admire in her château of Ruel-Malmaison, near Paris.  She built up collections that symbolised French interest and knowledge in new lands, the natural world and distant societies, and engaged famous botanists like Étienne Pierre Ventenat  (the brother of the naturalist Louis Ventenat*), to take care of the plants and seeds. She requested him to document them and invited the artist Pierre-Joseph Redouté to prepare illustrations. Hence, in his work entitled ‘the garden of La Malmaison’, Ventenat labels and describes plants from New Holland brought back by the Baudin expedition that he cultivated in the greenhouse of La Malmaison, such as ‘Josephinia imperatricis’. He notes that it is ‘an herbaceous plant … it comes from New Holland seeds brought back by Captain Hamelin; and it blooms in the middle of summer …’. In a footnote, Ventenat advised that ‘the honour to dedicate a specific genus to the august empress of the French had to be authorised by the author of the garden of la Malmaison. May this humble homage become a testament of the informed protection that her Majesty provided to the sciences, and the radiance she gave to it’. The other famous arrivals from New-Holland in Joséphine’s Park were a Kangaroo (Kanguroo kingiensis), embarked at King Island by Baudin (two others died during the voyage), two emus (Dromaius ater, Dromaius Baudinianus), one from King Island, the other from Kangaroo Island belonging to two species now extinct, and black swans who bred in France and of which Joséphine was particularly fond. Joséphine’s first lady in waiting wrote in her memoires in reference to the arrival in Paris of the European coalition against Napoléon in 1814: ‘… the empress had been forced to leave La Malmaison; the black swans just had offsprings; she had a real fear that her swans would be killed by the foreign soldiers. Fortunately, nothing bad happen to them.’

    Further information: Baudin named the gulf ‘Golfe de la Mauvaise [nasty gulph] because of the fatigue that it caused to the whole crew’. However, he renamed it golfe de la Misanthropie when rough charts of these coasts were sketched. ‘Gulf St Vincent’ is the name chosen by Matthew Flinders on 30 March 1802 after the Earl of Saint Vincent, who succeeded Lord Spencer as first Lord of the Admiralty.
