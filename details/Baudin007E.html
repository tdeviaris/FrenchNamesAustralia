    The fact that Richelieu was both a cardinal and a prime minister does not mean that he governed the Church of France; his position as cardinal conferred upon him ecclesiastical responsibilities, but it was the kingin this case, Louis XIII, who held authority over the French Church. What the king expected from his chief minister was to work toward the centralization of power and the pursuit of raison d’État. It is perhaps no coincidence that Cape Richelieu lies in Talleyrand Bay, for both men served as foreign ministers and state-builders—though they could scarcely have been more different. During the reign of Louis XIII, Richelieu was a statesman of firm judgment, devoted to absolute power and the glory of France, whereas, During the Napoleonic period, Talleyrand was a pragmatic and adaptable diplomat, serving France in the name of moderation and equilibrium—an equilibrium of France inseparable from that of Europe itself.

    Further information: One of the islands of St Peter (South Australia) was also named after the Cardinal, as Île Richelieu The cape now bears the name of Cape Schanck, after Captain John Schank RN, an engineer who introduced sliding keels on ships used by the British Royal Navy. One of these ships was the 60-ton brig Lady Nelson, built at Deptford in 1799 and used in the early survey of the south-east coast of Australia by James Grant in 1801.
