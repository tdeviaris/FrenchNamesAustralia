     Citizen Captain,
    </p>
	    <p>
	     According to the order you gave me yesterday to go, together with the mineralogist Bailly, to ascertain where a very thick smoke seen on shore might be coming from, I headed toward it so as to be better placed to verify the matter on the spot.
	    </p>
	    <figure>
	     <img alt="" src="rapport2_image1.jpg"/>
	    </figure>
	    <p>
	     On my way I saw through a spyglass some men (who seemed to me to be clothed) walking along the beach and moving toward the place where I wished to land. I soon lost sight of them. They seemed to be about fifteen in number, but my eyes may have deceived me, and as our large boat was on the island, I believed that the men we had seen were those of its crew.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	     When I was half a mile from shore, I did not find enough water to move the boat any farther, and not wishing to waste time looking for an easy landing place, I went into the water to reach the shore. Citizens Bailly, Colas, and three boatmen followed me.
	    </p>
	    <figure>
	     <img alt="" src="rapport2_image2.jpg"/>
	    </figure>
	    <figure>
	     <img alt="" src="rapport2_image3.jpg"/>
	    </figure>
	    <p>
	     I certainly did not foresee the encounter I was about to have, and I had not instructed anyone not to stray. I was with only one boatman within calling distance of the seashore (the others were fifty paces behind me) when I saw nine unarmed Natives come out from behind a small mound.
	    </p>
	    <figure>
	     <img alt="" src="rapport2_image4.jpg"/>
	    </figure>
	    <p>
	     I continued to advance, signaling to them with my handkerchief, but then they all took up their weapons, which seemed to me to consist of a spear and a sort of wooden saber; they scrambled up a small mound and motioned for me to go back. If I had had a few trinkets to offer them, I would not have hesitated to leave my weapons in the hands of the boatman beside me and go alone toward them to make a few presents and become acquainted; but I had not brought any, and as I intended to return on board, I stopped so that all the people behind me would have time to catch up with me.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	     Probably these Natives took for timidity what in me was only prudence and, emboldened by this notion, they all sprang at once from the top of the mound (chanting, I presume, their war song) down onto the beach and even advanced a few steps into the water, holding their spear in one hand and the saber in the other.
	    </p>
    <p>
     What was I to do at that moment? I was in the water and I could not flee. Besides, even if I could have, I would not have wished to. Nor did I wish to expose myself to a violent response against men who did not know how greatly our strength exceeded theirs—a response all the less necessary, or rather all the more to be avoided, since we should instead use every possible means to secure their friendship.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	     They continued to advance, and my gestures of friendship had not convinced them of my peaceful intentions. I nevertheless ordered that no one should fire unless I deemed it necessary; but in the hope of inspiring some fear in them, without shedding blood, I fired a musket shot into the air.
	    </p>
	    <figure>
	     <img alt="" src="rapport2_image5.jpg"/>
	    </figure>
	    <p>
	     This report produced the effect I desired, and after hesitating, they took flight, though at no great speed.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	     I repeated my orders that no one should fire, and I moved toward the five large fires lit not far from the shore. I approached them to within about twenty paces and saw Natives around each of them. I had seen enough; I could not, even had I spoken with one or more of them, inspire great confidence, since I had nothing to give them; and rather than expose myself to being forced to defend myself against their hostilities, I retraced my steps.
	    </p>
	    <figure>
	     <img alt="" src="rapport2_image6.jpg"/>
	    </figure>
	    <p>
	     The mineralogist wished to see what kind of very red earth bordered the sea in certain places; I also wished to visit the fire from which such thick smoke had arisen that it had been seen from the ship, and I was very surprised, when I reached the rise, to see only a hearth no wider than an ordinary dish, still glowing, from which it had originated. The fishing, however, that these men had done must have been abundant, for I found there a great number of rays that they had abandoned.
	    </p>
	    <figure>
	     <img alt="" src="rapport2_image7.jpg"/>
	    </figure>
	    <p>
	     From the top of this eminence, we saw inland a stretch of sand that ran all the way to the sea, and I was all the more justified in believing it was the bank of a river or an arm of the sea, as it seemed to connect with the small inlet visible from the ship. I could not, it is true, see water at the foot of this sand, but I noted that the lay of the land prevented me from doing so. I did, however, notice a small body of water nearby, but it was not considerable.
	    </p>
    <p>
     I had forgotten to mention that I saw footprints so small that I judged them to be those of a three-year-old child. I therefore have reason to suppose that their mothers are there, and we are almost certain in thinking that the men I saw are natives of the island, if indeed it is one. Let me explain: either what I saw is a great mainland, or it is an island; but in the latter case I have tacked from east to west over a greater extent than the charts even indicate for the island’s circumference.
    </p>
    <p>
     In general, the men I saw are of small stature; only one was fairly tall, if my eye was true. They are well built. They are of a finer black than the natives we saw in Gulf G, but their hair is kinky, though quite woolly, like that of the inhabitants of New Guinea. I caught sight of an animal that seemed to me to be a dog. It was beside the Natives when they wished to attack me. I also saw in the sand tracks that indicate the presence of this quadruped on the island.
    </p>
    <p>
     There, Citizen, is the account of what I saw and did. I dare to hope that, given the circumstances, you will approve my conduct.
    </p>
