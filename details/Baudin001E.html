    The naming of the bay after Colonel William Paterson (1755–1810), then lieutenant-governor of the colony, was a rare honour — one unusually granted by the visiting French expedition to a foreign national. Yet, beneath the courteous exchange of scientific information about the region’s natural history, Paterson was also fulfilling his duties as a vigilant officer of the Crown. By supervising and escorting the French scientists around Port Jackson, he kept a watchful eye on their activities. To be sure, he assisted Péron in compiling vocabularies of the Aboriginal language and provided specimens to the visiting mineralogists. In return, Leschénault, the expedition’s botanist, presented him with plant samples he had collected — specimens that Paterson later sent to Joseph Banks in England for identification. The garden at the lieutenant governor’s residence, which Paterson had helped to develop, drew particular admiration — tinged with a hint of envy — from Péron, who wrote: “There, interesting experiments are being ardently pursued to naturalise plants foreign to the colony. It is also there that the most remarkable native plants have been gathered to enrich the famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. From here have come most of those specimens of which England has recently made such valuable acquisitions, and which have become, for English naturalists, the source of honourable works. An enlightened, tireless and modest botanist, Mr. Cayley, came from Europe to oversee the Parramatta garden; and the learned Colonel Paterson, to whom New South Wales owes this establishment [the garden], has continued to take a keen interest in it.” However, Paterson’s exchanges with the French scientists were not as disinterested as they appeared to Péron, and, as a good English lieutenant keen to defend the interests of his country, he also gathered some intelligence on the objectives of the French voyage and the intentions of the scientists in Australia, which he passed on to Governor King. What most alarmed the latter was information (attributed to Péron) suggesting that the French intended to establish a settlement in Tasmania. This prompted King to send a ship carrying a letter after the just departed Baudin, confronting him with this new information. The French commander received the letter on King Island (Bass Straight) and assured King that the rumors were false. No substantiated plans by the French to colonize Tasmania have so far emerged.

    Further information: Paterson Bay was renamed after a ship called ‘The Waratah’ was beached in the area on the 11/04/1846.
