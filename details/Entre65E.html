    Cape Riche, located a few hundred kilometers west of Esperance Bay, recalls Riche’s excursion of December 14, unexpectedly prolonged until the 16th, which enabled him to report the discovery of “a mass of petrified wood.” In the report he submitted to d’Entrecasteaux, Riche explains: “this destroyed forest occupied the whole coast and seemed to have extended to the dunes. The ancients could have regarded this as the vestige of a once fertile Gorgon valley” (Riche refers here to Greek mythologogy, according to which Gorgons turned their human prey to stone) During this exploration, he came across a salt lake, which he assumed to be connected to the sea, though he failed to find the proper outlet. He does not, however, mention the pink hue for which the lakes of the region are famous, perhaps due to the overcast weather. He nevertheless suggested that the salt lakes were “not the result of the sea’s retreat, but of its gradual advance upon this coast” (p. 203). He also discovered swampy valleys sheltering “many different species of birds,” including Galahs. He ‘saw many places where the natives had built fires’ and wondered for what reasons would they build large fires all day in such a hot climate. He mentions that “some travellers have declared that the inhabitants tried to protect themselves from the importunity of moquitoes; these insects bothered me a great deal in fact…” His beliefs and sharp judgments concerning the Aboriginal peoples must be understood in the context of the profound lack of knowledge Europeans of the time had regarding their cultures.
