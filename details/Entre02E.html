    The expedition dropped anchor at Port du Nord. D’Entrecasteaux explains: “The port where we stayed is the most suitable place for making the repairs that may be required due to the heavy weather to which one is exposed in these stormy seas; the other large bays discovered in the northeastern part of Recherche Bay, though offering shelters no less safe, would be too vast, and the sea there too rough to allow such operations to be undertaken: they are very beautiful and magnificent roadsteads, situated in the vicinity of an excellent harbor.” The gardener Lahaye* (or Lahaie; see entry Île Lahaye) established a vegetable garden near the shore, “to the east-northeast of our anchorage.” Labillardière* specifies: “We had on board a great variety of European seeds, which it was useful to propagate at this extremity of New Holland. The degree of temperature experienced there led us to hope they would succeed. We had on board a large variety of European grains of different kinds, which could be advantageously propagated at this extremity of New Holland. The prevailing climate in this country made us hope for their success.” The main purpose of this type of garden was to provide fresh vegetables for European voyagers crossing the southern seas. However, upon returning in 1793 to the site of the vegetable garden, the seeds had not produced, and Lahaye attributed the failure of his garden to the fact that the sowing had taken place too late in the season. The botanist Labillardière discovered an evergreen tree, whose fruit resembles the cashew, and named it Exocarpos cupressiformis. Piron, the expedition’s painter, made various views of the landscape, whose beauty captivated both the commander and the men of science. In 1792, crew members from each of the vessels built an observatory on the shore of the bay in order to carry out astronomical observations. The two observatories were erected close to one another, to facilitate communication and the exchange of information, as well as the services required for the maintenance and repair of the ships. The astronomical observations, though limited by weather conditions and lack of time, were compared with those obtained the following year at Port du Sud, thus confirming the geographical coordinates of the two ports. Le botaniste Labillardière découvrit un arbre à feuillage persistant, dont le fruit rappelle la noix de cajou, et le nomma Exocarpos cupressiformis.
