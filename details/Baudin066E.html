    Mme de Chastenay drawn by an unknown artist. She has short hair, curly in the front (referred to as ‘à la Titus’), in reference to women who were guillotined and, later on, as a sign of independence. In  Mémoires de Mme de Chastenay, (see above)

    Pointe Victorine’s area features tidal flats that are submerged four times daily by tidal movements and serves as important habitat for a wide variety of resident shorebirds, including Pied and Sooty Oystercatchers, Hooded Plovers, Pied Cormorants, Great Egrets, Banded Stilts, and Red-Capped Plovers. The First Nations people have long recognised this area as a key feeding and roosting site for local, regional, and migratory birds that travel along the flyway each year. In the Kaurna language, this place is part of the land known as Winaityinaityi Pangkara, meaning “a country for all birds and the country that surrounds these birds.” Today, the Port Gawler Conservation Park is incorporated into the Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary (AIBS) National Park, which also bears the name Winaityinaityi Pangkara.

    Victorine de Chastenay was very fond of Péron, commenting: “Nothing could have distracted us more pleasantly than his fruitful and lively conversation. He often consoled and entertained my father and inspired in all of us a genuine affection. How simple, easy-going, and good-natured he was!”

    Further information: It was from Pointe Victorine that Freycinet, aboard the Casuarina, resumed in January 1803 the geographical surveys of the Gulf of St Vincent that Baudin had been unable to continue in April 1802 due to bad weather and the draught of the corvette Le Géographe. Faithful to his instructions and aware of the risks involved in such a discovery, Baudin noted in his mission order given to Freycinet: ‘As the Government has not asked me to provide a topographical description of the land of New Holland, but only to reconnoitre the coast, you should only make land in a place where you are certain of being able to complete your water easily. Should you come across large inlets you should return here prior to visiting them, so that I can take the ship in. The same applies, should the inlets, that we have considered to be gulfs, prove in fact to be two islands.’ However, Freycinet did not approach the Samphire Coast, because the depth decreased significantly, “leaving only two fathoms”; and this variation in depth forced him “to set a course north”.
