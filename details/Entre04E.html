     The original naming of this
group of islands and islet by the French as îles Stériles and
Rocher Blanc (White Rock), reflect more the perspective of European
explorers, for whom a sterile landscape signified a space
inhospitable to agriculture and human settlement, than on the actual
natural environment of these islands: Sterile Island is covered with
tussock grass and bushes

     The officers’ very first
concern was of the dangers and hazards these islets represented for
navigation: In the report on his survey of the coasts near Recherche
Bay, Lieutenant Alexis-Ignace de Cretin reports: ‘I had been
ordered to visit the coasts situated east and north-east of Port du
Nord. I left Recherche Bay on the morning of 30 April and was soon
joined by the boat from
     <i>
      l’Esperance
     </i>
     , commanded by M. de la
Grandière, lieutenant de vaisseau. As we were leaving Port du Nord,
we followed the coast to larboard. After passing the land for one
league, we found ourselves in the middle of rocks which were
protruding far offshore; some of these rocks were level with the
water, others were rather high … We followed the coast in a
northerly direction to pass windward of the Sterile Islands, and the
dangers to starboard.’

     D’Entrecasteaux notes: “I
would have wished to pass between Ormiers Cove and the Sterile
Islands; but at that time we did not know the passage well enough to
attempt it. We therefore sailed very close to the breakers lying to
the south of the Sterile Islands; their position is thus well
established. I do not hesitate to present the chart of this area as
one of the most accurate that have been made during the course of the
voyages undertaken in recent times” (May 1792, p.79, vol. 1)

     The rocks and breakers which de
Cretin and d’Entrecasteaux observed form part of the Actaeon Island
Group. They consist of a system of small low-lying islands, rocky
islets and extensive reefs. Their generally barren nature must have
prompted d’Entrecasteaux to give the name of Sterile Island to one
of these small specks of land.
