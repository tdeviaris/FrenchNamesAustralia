    The original naming of this group of islands and islet by the French as îles Stériles and Rocher Blanc (White Rock), reflect more the perspective of European explorers, for whom a sterile landscape signified a space inhospitable to agriculture and human settlement, than on the actual natural environment of these islands: Sterile Island is covered with tussock grass and bushes
   </p>
   <p>
    The officers’ very first concern was of the dangers and hazards these islets represented for navigation: In the report on his survey of the coasts near Recherche Bay, Lieutenant Alexis-Ignace de Cretin reports: ‘I had been ordered to visit the coasts situated east and north-east of Port du Nord. I left Recherche Bay on the morning of 30 April and was soon joined by the boat from l’Esperance, commanded by M. de la Grandière, lieutenant de vaisseau. As we were leaving Port du Nord, we followed the coast to larboard. After passing the land for one league, we found ourselves in the middle of rocks which were protruding far offshore; some of these rocks were level with the water, others were rather high … We followed the coast in a northerly direction to pass windward of the Sterile Islands, and the dangers to starboard.’ D’Entrecasteaux notes: “I would have wished to pass between Ormiers Cove and the Sterile Islands; but at that time we did not know the passage well enough to attempt it. We therefore sailed very close to the breakers lying to the south of the Sterile Islands; their position is thus well established. I do not hesitate to present the chart of this area as one of the most accurate that have been made during the course of the voyages undertaken in recent times” (May 1792, p.79, vol. 1) The rocks and breakers which de Cretin and d’Entrecasteaux observed form part of the Actaeon Island Group. They consist of a system of small low-lying islands, rocky islets and extensive reefs. Their generally barren nature must have prompted d’Entrecasteaux to give the name of Sterile Island to one of these small specks of land.
