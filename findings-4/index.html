            <p>To name geographical locations, the expedition commander relied on the hydrographic surveys and sketches provided by his geographers and officers. The procedure was as follows: Firstly, the ships’ hydrographers (given the title &#x27;engineer geographers&#x27; then on later voyages of discovery) recorded the geographical coordinates of the shapes and indentations coastline, sketched them roughly and then drafted an early chart. They used the letters of the alphabet A, B, C… to designate capes, bays and other geographical shapes that made up the coastline. The commander would then give a name to the geographical features identified by his engineer geographers. He also entered into the pages of his sea journal the locality names he had chosen.</p>
            <p>The edition of d’Entrecasteaux sea journal</p>
            <p>Following the short-lived peace treaty signed at Amiens in 1802, the British returned the d’Entrecasteaux expeditions journals, charts and papers to France (see above, footnote 15). The royalist Rossel, who was the last commander of the expedition after the death of d’Entrecasteaux and his successors, returned to France from London at that time, and received permission to edit the journal of his former commander. It came with the proviso that he must cooperate with Beautemps-Beaupré, the expedition’s hydrographer, now working at the dépôt des cartes et plans de la Marine (the State cartographic service and hydrographic office) where he oversaw the editing the atlas of the d’Entrecasteaux voyage, and added the names chosen by d’Entrecasteaux onto the charts. The atlas was published in 1808 to great acclaim by the press and the scientific community.</p>

            <p>A nomenclature that pays tribute to the voyage</p>
            <p>In this altas, the Carte générale de la Nouvelle Hollande et des archipels du grand ocean (plate 1, <a href="https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-230810237/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-230810237/view</a>) and 10 other plates show 68 new place names for locations along parts of the Australian coastline visited by the expedition, all defined in the first part of this book. Their selection must be viewed in the context of the tense revolutionary situation and the civil war in France, which clearly influenced the commander’s choice. D’Entrecasteaux cautiously avoided choosing names with a connotation too obviously royal, noble or revolutionary. The bestowing of such names would have exacerbated the underlying tensions among his crew. In avoiding political or doctrinal references, his chosen names pay tribute to his crew, aspects of the expedition or relate to natural features discovered along the Australian coast. Diplomatically, D’Entrecasteaux also acknowledged Saint-Alloüarn’s nautical work by naming a group of islands near Cape Leeuwin after him*. D’Entrecasteaux was also aware of the violent episode between Marion’s crew and the Tasmanians, and it was with relief and recognition that he reported that to the natives’ credit, during his own voyage, the latter were &#x27;kind, without mistrust&#x27;, with &#x27;peaceful dispositions&#x27;. He considered the hypothesis that Marion had met a different group of &#x27;ferocious savages&#x27; (see his chapter XI, p. 228–257) rather than the kind and cordial of the inhabitants of the coasts observed by Captain Cook at Adventure Bay, Captain Cox at Oyster Bay, and by his own expedition in Port du Nord. He also believed that the encounter did not take place at Frederik Hendrick Bay, as Marion thought, by basing his deduction on his own bearings and the summary of Tasman’s voyage given by Valentijn (1724–1726), but that it had occurred in a bay further east-north-east, which he named Baie Marion*. As well as honouring the achievements of these two earlier explorers with place names, he recognized the work of his officers and crew, who were gratified at having place named after them, regardless of their diverse political views. Other names he selected were those of his two frigates, of daily challenges (Cap des Contrariétés (Cape Contrarieties, in Tasmania) and others which recognised the geography and natural history of the coasts.</p>
            <p>In contrast, conceived amidst the Napoleonic empire, Péron and Freycinet’s nomenclature did not follow d’Entrecasteaux’s tactful neutrality.</p>
