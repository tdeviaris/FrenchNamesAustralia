            <p>The successive critical circumstances and national mutations outlined above permeate the nomenclatures applied to the geographical features of the Australian coast by participants in the d’Entrecasteaux and Baudin voyages of discovery.</p>
            <p>The site explicitly addresses these nomenclatures and the significance of the 670 place names recorded on the official atlases of the two voyages. It outlines their embedded connections with French history by pointing out the heroes, events and myths that contributed to the building of the French nation. It shows that the history and cartographical fixation of the place names leads &#x27;to identifying the actors involved in the naming more than the places themselves&#x27;. In this context, the immediate actors involved in the naming were d’Entrecasteaux and the editors of the atlases of the two voyages. They were acting under the direction of the French government and scientific authorities, as representatives of their national ideals and values. It is this influential and cultural background the book seeks to highlight.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that no inquiries about local, pre-existing names were made by the crews of the two expeditions in their encounters with the &#x27;naturals&#x27;. The French names along the Australian coast instead recognise the expeditions’ ships, pay tribute to their crews and the kings and authorities who sponsored these voyages and acknowledge some of the great men who brought honour to the French nation. The commanders of the two expeditions, d’Entrecasteaux and Baudin, named localities and geographical features in accordance with the European notion of &#x27;the right of first discovery&#x27;, introduced in the late 15th and 16th century which 19th-century European historians designated as &#x27;the period of great discoveries&#x27;. This notion gave the right to sea captains who visited coastlines yet unknown to Europe to name geographical features they were the first to chart, on behalf of king and nation. This tacitly agreed naming practice among Europeans intensified towards the end of the eighteenth century when rival European powers were competing to extend their respective presence throughout the world.</p>
            <p>The ‘right of the first discovery’ did not necessarily confer a right to colonisation, nor were such opportunities always pursued, although it was an option available to the nation of the first discoverer. Neither the Dutch nor the French authorities took up this right in Australia. However, the practice of Europeans to apply proper names to geographical places in Australia disregarding preexisting native names served them in their claims for the southern lands. The exercise of these naming rights also resulted in discord between François Péron* and Louis de Freycinet*, who respectively served as zoologist and naval officer on the Baudin expedition, and who edited the French narratives and atlases of the voyage, and the English navigator Matthew Flinders (see section 5).</p>
            <p>Fundamentally, the d’Entrecasteaux and Baudin nomenclatures produced two contrasting lists of names that reflect the evolving political and cultural changes affecting the French nation from the Revolutionary to the Napoleonic period. In contrast with that of the d’Entrecasteaux expedition, and unparalleled in European voyages of discoveries, the place names chosen by Baudin were not retained by his zoologist François Péron and his officer Louis Freycinet, who, in the absence of their deceased commander, were appointed in Paris at their request as editors of the narrative and the atlases of the voyage. With a few exceptions, Péron and Freycinet replaced Baudin’s names when preparing the atlas and narrative between 1805 and 1807 with others generally reflecting the French national spirit of the Napoleonic time, when voyages on the high seas and the discovery of distant lands played a less important role in Napoléon’s strategy. In contrast, Rossel, who edited the journals of d’Entrecasteaux’s voyage, retained all the names his commander had given to locations on Australia’s coasts, despite his death during the course of the voyage.</p>
